       "  'content': '<p>12 tips for taking care of your customers<br />By <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/brm/ask_editors.asp\">Dana Dratch</a> • Bankrate.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you drop your old friends as soon as you acquire new ones? That\\'s not a smart business move. Old customers, especially those who return often, are a business\\'s best friend.</p><p>\"It costs five times as much to attract a new customer as it does to keep an existing one,\" according to Norman Scarborough, assistant professor of economics and business administration at Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C.</p><p>It\\'s also smart marketing to reach out to someone who has already been a customer in the past. \"That\\'s an easy sale,\" says Scarborough, a co-author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130172804/greenmagazinecom\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Essentials of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management</i></a>. \"They\\'re already there.\"\\xa0</p><p>Here are a dozen ways to keep customers coming back:</p><p>1. Get to know your customers. \"And that takes data,\" says Scarborough. He cites Harrah\\'s Entertainment Inc., which operates a nationwide network of casinos, as an expert at data mining. With one popular loyalty card program, Harrah\\'s can track which games a customer played, as well as ancillary interests like restaurants and shows.</p><p>\"They know each individual\\'s hot buttons,\" says Scarborough. Based on customer preferences, the company sends special mailings with deals on games, shows or activities likely to appeal to patrons.</p><p>Don\\'t have the technology or know-how for a customer card? Take a low-tech approach. Talk to your customers regularly about what they want and need from your business. For more details, ask them to complete a survey or feedback form -- in return for a generous discount on their next order. If you have a Web site, make it easy for them to send an e-mail rating the service.</p><p>\"You have to develop a relationship where they know you value their opinion,\" says Kim T. Gordon, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039952598X/greenmagazinecom\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Bringing Home the Business</i></a>.</p><p>2. Give customers something new. Last year, when organizers of the Indian River Festival of Fine Music wanted to stem declining attendance at the annual summer event, they started selling it a little differently, says Doug Hall, CEO of Eureka! Ranch, a Cincinnati-based business consulting firm. Rather than focus on the music, they added candles, flowers and oysters at intermission and touted the Prince Edward Island festival as a romantic experience, says Hall, an adviser to the festival board. The result: despite a 20 percent price increase, attendance went up 50 percent.</p><p>\"Come up with ways that are exciting enough to bring new customers in to buy and chances are you will keep your old customers happy,\" says Hall, author of <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558706070/greenmagazinecom\" target=\"_blank\">Jump Start Your Business Brain</a></i>. \"But if what you\\'re offering today is the same thing you were offering six to nine months ago, you\\'re dying and you don\\'t even know it.\"</p><p>3. Respond immediately to problems. \"It doesn\\'t matter who\\'s right, make the appropriate restitution,\" says Gordon. \"And do something fast.\" Even though your business is your baby and the customer may be a little hot under the collar, step back and \"set personal feelings aside,\" Gordon says. Your goal is to make the customer happy and keep that person coming back.</p><p>4. Stay in touch. Don\\'t let customers go too long without thinking of your business. You can use a variety of methods to get your message across: direct mailer, e-mail, phone call or fax. Every four to six weeks is a good rule of thumb, says Gordon, who also recommends segmenting your database. Top customers might get communications more often, others less.</p><p>Elaine Biech, owner of <a href=\"http://www.ebbweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ebb associates inc</a>, an 18-year-old business consulting firm, has specially-designed cards that she sends to clients for special occasions or when they\\'ve met a business or personal goal. \"A handwritten note only has to be three sentences,\" says Biech, author of <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0787956678/greenmagazinecom\" target=\"_blank\">The Consultant\\'s Quick Start Guide</a></i>.</p><p>And Biech says businesses can get even more bang for the buck with a clever promotion targeted to a smaller holiday, like Valentine\\'s Day or St. Patrick\\'s Day when no one else is spending anything. \"[Customers] know you\\'re thinking about them and they appreciate it,\" she says.</p><p>5. Set yourself apart. \"Avoid being a \\'me too\\' business,\" says Scarborough. \"Differentiate yourself from the competition.\"</p><p>In 1994, Albert Straus was facing the loss of his dairy farm, which had been in the family for generations. So he took his Marshall, Calif., farm organic. Now, yearly sales at the Straus Family Creamery top $7.6 million, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet estimates.</p><p>Another plus: Give your customers something they can\\'t get anywhere else, and you can command a higher price, Scarborough says.</p><p>6. Follow up with customers. Whether you\\'re a plumber or an auto mechanic, contact your customers after the job and find out what they think of the work, says Jan Norman, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101129/greenmagazinecom\" target=\"_blank\"><i>What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business</i></a>. That way, if they are happy, you can ask for referrals. If they\\'re not, you\\'re the first to know and have a chance to set things right.</p><p>Don\\'t fall into believing that \"if I ever make a mistake, I\\'ve lost a customer,\" says Norman. If you follow up with customers and correct problems to their satisfaction, they will probably be even more loyal because they know you care.</p><p>7. Entertain your customers. \"You have to become almost a destination for your customers,\" says Scarborough. \"Make it fun and interesting.\"</p><p>In the Boston area, the Jordan\\'s Furniture chain attracts customers with fanciful re-creations of famous places, like a recent Bourbon Street scene that featured an automatronic Louis Armstrong. \"They\\'ve done an amazing job,\" says Scarborough. \"You think \\'furniture store -- how exciting can that be?\\' But these guys have done a lot with it.\"</p><p>8. Give your customers superior service and convenience. \"People are so busy that many customers are willing to pay for extra convenience,\" says Scarborough. Likewise, if they get great service at your store they\\'ll be less likely to switch when a new one moves in down the street.</p><p>At Texas-based <a href=\"http://www.joeauto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JoeAuto</a>, customers can schedule their service appointments online. And while their car is in the shop, they can watch the mechanic at work via real-time cameras.</p><p>9. Emphasize value. If you\\'re competing with a superstore, you may not have the cheapest price in town, but you can still offer the best value. In the long run, that\\'s a much smarter strategy, says Norman. \"You\\'re not going to keep loyal customers based on price,\" she says. \"The minute someone is a penny lower, you\\'ve lost them.\"</p><p>10. Find out what the customer wants and provide it. Sounds like a no-brainer, right? But too many small businesses overlook the obvious. Beartooth Mapping Inc., based in Red Lodge, Mont., started out offering topographical maps to government agencies. Campers, hunters and outdoor aficionados also liked their products, so the company now has a <a href=\"http://www.mytopo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Web site</a> where customers can order custom-made maps. \"They make it very, very simple for the customer to get what they want,\" says Scarborough. \"And they\\'re using the Web as a marketing tool.\"</p><p>11. Give customers more than they expect. Whether it\\'s spending a few extra (non-billable) minutes helping one client solve a problem, taking others to breakfast a few times a year, or becoming the expert they can call for solid research, give your customers more than they pay for, says Biech. Often, she will order books or reprints of magazine articles on timely topics and send them to clients with a short note.</p><p>\"I have the reputation of being a resource center,\" she says. The approach has paid off. \"I can track 75 percent of my clients back to my first client,\" she says. \"There\\'s a definite trail.\"</p><p>12. Reward your customers. \"Ever had dinner at a restaurant and been surprised with a free dessert?\" says Gordon. \"It\\'s a great idea. You\\'ve got the folks there, you\\'ve got the product. It costs very little. And there are lots of ways you can reward customers.\"</p><p>From promotional calendars to pens to writing tablets with your logo, there are all kinds of inexpensive, inventive ways to say \"thanks.\" Gordon recalls a mail-order firm that used to send a gift with every order. It was always something small, inexpensive and very usable.</p><p>\"Essentially it made it fun to order,\" says Gordon. \"Things that are unexpected can help contribute to customer satisfaction.\"</p><p align=\"right\"><i>Dana Dratch is a freelance writer based in Georgia.</i></p><p align=\"right\">-- Posted: Feb. 6, 2002</p>',\n",

But unlike professionals, they often take the time to look back over their performance, analyzing in great detail what went well, what didn’t, and what contributed to their “game” either way.</p><p>Business coach Laura Garnett sees this as a lost opportunity. In a\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/laura-garnett/1-weekly-habit-for-peak-performance.html\">recent\\xa0<em>Inc.</em>\\xa0article</a>, she suggests that we could all use a bit of this athletic-style evaluation in our working lives—and proposes a series of 15 questions to ask yourself each week to reveal your peaks and dips in performance, energy, and excitement. “By going through these questions and answering them honestly, you will uncover the root cause of great or\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.themuse.com/advice/conquer-performance-review-panic\">less-than-optimal performance</a>,” she says, “and [can] make changes to enhance or avoid it going forward.”</p><p>No matter what kind of week you had today, try spending 15 minutes answering these questions and seeing what you can uncover about your work life:</p><ol><li>What was the most enjoyable work activity of the week?</li><li>How many enjoyable work moments did you have?</li><li>How many frustrating or boring moments did you have?</li><li>How would you describe your impact on others you work with, your customers, or those whom you come into contact with this week?</li><li>Is this the type of impact you want?</li><li>If not, what prompted this change in desired impact?</li><li>Were you challenged this week?</li><li>Were you bored?</li><li>What were your biggest and most exciting challenges this past week?</li><li>How confident did you feel this week?</li><li>Did you have any negative mental chatter about yourself?</li><li>Are you practicing actively believing that you can achieve whatever it is you have set your sights on?</li><li>Are you committed to having joy and groundbreaking results at work?</li><li>What distractions came up this week that prevented you from getting the most out of your job?</li><li>How can you avoid that going forward?</li></ol><p>Garnett advises going through this exercise at the end of each week, writing your responses down in an ongoing document you can reflect back on from time to time.

Even the most tedious chore will become endurable as you parade through each day convinced that every task, no matter how menial or boring, brings you closer to fulfilling your dreams.” – Og Mandino</p><p>Each day we wake up and have before us a new opportunity, a blank slate that we can fill with whatever we choose. We are in total control of what we will accomplish each day. Here are a few things I have found that help me to make the most of every day:</p><ol><li>Making the most of my day really starts the night prior when I choose to go to bed at an early hour in order to allow myself to get a good night’s sleep so I can awake rested and ready to face my day.</li><li>If I wake up early it helps me get a good start to the day by having time to have a good breakfast, read a few pages from an inspirational book to get my mind focused on the positive.</li><li>I have found that writing motivational quotes or sayings on my bathroom mirror with post it notes or dry erase markers really helps me to subconsciously focus on feeling positive as I start my day.</li><li>If my work space is clean and organized I find my mind can think more clearly and I can accomplish more.</li><li>If I can start my day with a checklist of the “must-do todays,” I can stay focused on my top priorities, and I am more likely to finish those things on this checklist before the day is done.</li><li>Going into my day expecting to accomplish great things typically ensures that great things will happen.</li><li>Keeping positive quotes and sayings around my workspace keeps me motivated and focused on a positive attitude and outlook. They keep me in a successful frame of mind.</li><li>I find that if I make the voice in my head remind me throughout the day that today I will accomplish everything on my list and today I will do great things, that I will have more success in my day.</li><li>Acknowledging the great people around you who are also doing great things each day, is a great way to feel gratitude for all you have been given. By the same token, I find that acknowledging God’s hand in my blessings throughout the day helps keep me both humble and grateful for all that I have.</li><li>Before I go to sleep at night I remind myself that I accomplished many things that day. Even if I made mistakes or had failures during my day, I try to identify what I learned from them, and I commit to be more dedicated tomorrow to making sure I don’t make the same mistakes again. Thus, I will constantly be improving.</li></ol><p>I realize that none of these tips seem mind blowing or significant, but it’s these small and simple things help me to make the most of each day.</p><p>The greatest successes in life don’t always require the mind of a genius or huge sums of money.\\xa0 The greatest successes in this world are often achieved by very ordinary people who make a very extraordinary effort. Attitude, work ethic, and gratitude may seem like small and simple things, but when applied to your daily life they can make a huge impact to your level of success.</p><p>~Amy\\xa0Rees Anderson (follow my daily blogs at\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.amyreesanderson.com/blog\">www.amyreesanderson.com/blog</a>\\xa0)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Amy Rees Andrerson is a contributor for Forbes</em></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">– Posted: March 28, 2014</p>',\n",

It sounded like an intense but satisfying life.</p><p>Then I asked him again, “How are you\\xa0<em>really</em>?” And the moment I did, he became emotional and the reality of his life just flooded out of him: his stress, his frustration of trying to juggle it all, his sense that he had no time to really think, or play with his children or enjoy any of it. The (cute) summary is this: his schedule was always filled but his life wasn’t fulfilled. What is less cute is the idea that he, and many of us, have been sold a bill of goods.</p><p>We’ve been sold on a heroic ideal of the uber-man and super-women who kill themselves saying yes to everyone, sleeping four hours a night and straining to fit everything in. How often have you heard people say, “I am\\xa0<em>so</em>\\xa0busy right now!” But it almost seemed like a back-door brag.</p><p>But it’s a bogus badge of honor. It suffocates our ability to think and create. It holds otherwise hard working, capable people back from our highest contribution. Below are a few of the myths of success that hold us back from becoming very successful.</p><p><strong>Myth 1: Successful people say, \"If I can fit it in, I should fit it in.\"</strong></p><p><em>Truth: Very successful people are absurdly selective.</em></p><p>As Warren Buffet is credited with having said, “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.”</p><p>As I wrote in a piece for Harvard Business Review, this means, \"Not just haphazardly saying no, but purposefully, deliberately, and strategically eliminating the nonessentials. Not just once a year as part of a planning meeting, but constantly reducing, focusing and simplifying. Not just getting rid of the obvious time wasters, but being willing to cut out really terrific opportunities as well. Few appear to have the courage to live this principle, which may be why it differentiates successful people and organizations from the very successful ones.\"</p><p><strong>Myth 2: Successful people sleep four hours a night.</strong></p><p><em>Truth: Very successful people rest well so they can be at peak performance.</em></p><p>In K. Anders Ericsson\\'s famous study of violinists, popularized by Malcolm Gladwell as the \"10,000 hour rule,\" Anders found that the best violinists spent more time practicing than the merely good students. What is less well known is that the second most important factor differentiating the best violinists from the good ones was actually sleep. The best violinists averaged 8.6 hours of sleep in every 24 hour period.</p><p><strong>Myth 3: Successful people think play is a waste of time.</strong></p><p><em>Truth: Very successful people see play as essential for creativity.</em></p><p>Just think of Sir Ken Robinson, who has made the study of creativity in school\\'s his life\\'s work. He has observed that instead of fueling creativity through play, schools actually kill it: \"We have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education, and it\\'s impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement.\"</p><p><strong>Myth 4: Successful people are the first ones to jump in with an answer.</strong></p><p><em>Truth: Very successful people are powerful listeners.</em></p><p>As the saying goes, the people who talk the most don\\'t always have the most to say. Powerful listeners get to the real story. They find the signal in the sound. They listen to what is not being said.</p><p><strong>Myth 5: Successful people focus on what the competition is doing.</strong></p><p><em>Truth: Very successful people focus on what they can do better.</em></p><p>The \"winningest coach in America\" is Larry Gelwix, the former Head of the Highland High School rugby team. His team won 418 games with only 10 losses in over 36 years. One of the key questions he challenged his players to ask was “What’s important now?\" He didn\\'t want his players getting distracted with what the other team was doing. He wanted them to play their own game.<em><br /></em></p><p>Last week I took a tour of the Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts. One of the quotes there grabbed my attention. John F. Kennedy said, \"The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.\"</p><p>The myth here is celebrated in modern culture: it’s someone who is capable, driven and wants to win and be popular. They have been rewarded for their willingness to take it all on, fit it all in and just make it happen. They believe doing more is better than doing less. I call this type of person a Nonessentialist.</p><p>Still, there is a new hero in our story. She asks, “What is essential?” and is willing to eliminate everything else. He says no to the less important activities so they can give themselves fully to the few things that really matter. It is a path that takes courage. It may require making the tradeoff between short-term popularity and long-term respect. It leads to a greater sense of control and even joy. But as an added benefit it also seems to be the thing that distinguishes the successful from the very successful.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">\\xa0</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Greg McKeown is the Author of \\xa0Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</em></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">– Posted: April 7, 2014</p>',\n",

At one point or another in our lives, we all face it.</p><p>Some of us simply deal with rejection and move on. Others take steps to learn and improve so it doesn\\'t happen again. In the case of job candidates, however, the majority don\\'t like to go down quietly.</p><p>20 years ago, this might not have been that big of a deal. In today\\'s social media-driven world, however, the result can impact your brand, your reputation and even your bottom line.</p><p>How? Because job candidates who are rejected don\\'t simply mumble their grievances. They shout them over Facebook, rehash them on Twitter and vent about them on YouTube. Their opinions and problems with your company are visible for the entire world to see, and you suffer because of it.</p><p>So, what\\'s the solution? You can\\'t stop job candidates from posting on social media, but you can lessen the impact of a rejection so they might not want ruin your company\\'s image.</p><h2>Rejecting candidates the right way</h2><p><strong>Follow up:\\xa0</strong>Every candidate who applies for a position within your company should receive a follow-up call or email to let them know exactly what happened — even those who didn\\'t get the job. While it may seem harsh to send out an email telling them they aren\\'t going to be working for you, most candidates agree that ignorance isn\\'t bliss. They\\'d much rather know than be left wondering.</p><p><strong>Make the time:</strong>\\xa0Most employers use the excuse \"I don\\'t have time,\" for not following up with job candidates after they have applied for a position. Don\\'t be one of them. It only takes a few minutes to create a rejection letter template for your email, which you can use over and over again.</p><p><strong>Be honest about why:</strong>\\xa0Most candidates want an explanation for why they weren\\'t good enough, and it\\'s important you give them one. Be honest and concise about the reasons.</p><p><strong>Be nice:</strong>\\xa0Even if the candidate walks into the interview wearing wrinkled clothes, had a bad attitude and the entire interview was a disaster, that doesn\\'t mean you should be unkind. Nastiness is never called for, and it can definitely\\xa0<a href=\"http://exclusive.multibriefs.com/content/dont-learn-email-etiquette-the-hard-way\">come back to haunt you</a>.</p><p><strong>Think to the future:</strong>\\xa0Even if a candidate isn\\'t right for a current position, don\\'t disqualify him completely. If you believe he would be a strong candidate for a future job, let him know you\\'ll be keeping his application on file.</p><p><strong>Don’t Give False Hope-</strong>\\xa0That being said, if the candidate isn\\'t qualified, and you can\\'t see hiring him in the future, don\\'t give him false hope. Let him know you won\\'t be hiring him now or in the future by wishing him success on his job search.</p><p>Keeping your reputation strong depends greatly on how you act toward your job candidates. Even if you don\\'t want to hire them, be kind and courteous enough to let them know and to tell them why.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">\\xa0</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Karen Rehn is the President and CEO of HH Staffing Services<br /></em><em>– Posted: March 31st, 2013</em></p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p><strong>4 Ways to Find Purpose in Any Job<br /></strong>By:\\xa0<a title=\"Author Steve Errey\" href=\"https://www.themuse.com/author/steve-errey\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Errey</a>\\xa0• LinkedIn<strong><br /></strong></p><p>f I read one more article about \"finding your passion\" or \"discovering your purpose\" I\\'m going to scream. Then shake someone. Yell at them a bit. Then eat ice cream to soothe my jangled nerves.</p><p>You know the articles I\\'m talking about. Go-getting, chest-bumping, happy-clappy, tree-hugging, super-trite advice that might give you the warm fuzzies, but that nobody has ever gainfully applied.</p><p>So, in finding myself writing an article about\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.themuse.com/advice/the-shift-that-will-get-you-excited-about-your-job-again\">giving yourself purpose at work</a>, I can either add to the self-help mountain of bilge or I can offer something that might actually be of use.</p><p>I like the idea of being useful. It\\'s part of my purpose here (so to speak). So, here are a handful of ways you can\\xa0<em>really</em>\\xa0give yourself purpose at work.</p><p><strong>\\xa01. Dial Up the Texture of Experience</strong></p><p>The rookie mistake with purpose is thinking that it needs to be one single thing with a big—even world-changing—impact.</p><p>Not a bit of it. Purpose can be found in the simple moments of life. Hold open a door for someone not because you ought to, but because you want to help out. Sincerely ask about a team member\\'s day not because you\\'re filling time waiting for the elevator, but because people fascinate you. Take a deep breath of fresh air not because you\\'re stressed out, but because you love how it feels in your belly or chest.</p><p>Purpose is texture as much as it is impact, so choosing to dial up the texture of your everyday experience is really choosing to weave purpose through your life.</p><p><strong>\\xa02. Know What Fuels You</strong></p><p>Purpose without meaning isn\\'t purpose. It\\'s filler.</p><p>When you know what you value right down in your bones—the things that mean most to you in yourself, in others, and out there in the world—you\\'re able to anchor any activity or behavior to a sense of something that genuinely matters, bringing your work alive with purpose.</p><p>If you value contribution, for example, find purpose by looking for ways you can contribute to a group, deliver over and above what a client expects, or give back to a local community. If you value laughter, be ready with a smile in your business relationships and always be generous with your humor. Or,\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.themuse.com/advice/how-your-network-can-help-you-be-better-at-your-job\">if you value connection</a>, openly connecting and sharing with the people around you will give you purpose.</p><p>These personal values aren\\'t fluffy ideals or hollow promises; they\\'re a hard-wired means to feel purposeful.</p><p><strong>\\xa03. Leave a Room Better Than When You Found It</strong></p><p>How many rooms are you in during a typical day at work? A couple? Four or five? Maybe as many as nine or 10?</p><p>Being in a room with other people is one of those things that happens every day, and you probably take it a little bit for granted. In you go, you do your thing, then you leave again. A bit like taking a shower, only with more clothes and less soap.</p><p>But look at it in a different, more purposeful way. What if you decided never to leave a room until you did something to contribute, make a difference, or leave it better than when you entered?</p><p>Whether it\\'s\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.themuse.com/advice/volunteer-your-way-to-the-top-the-power-of-pro-bono\">offering your insight or expertise</a>, complimenting someone on a job well done, or simply lending someone an ear, if you can find purpose in the next room you walk into, just imagine what kind of difference you can make throughout the next week, the next month, or the next year.</p><p><strong>\\xa04. Consider a Simpler Legacy</strong></p><p>The dictionary defines a legacy as\\xa0<em>a gift of property, by will</em>. It’s a definition that got me thinking.</p><p>The way I see it, we know full well that we have one shot at life on this curious little planet, and we all want to do our best and leave a mark of some kind. Truth is, we\\'re not all destined to leave a legacy like Michelangelo, Mother Teresa, or Mandela, and it\\'s that seeking of a world-changing legacy that keeps us stuck as we dream about<a href=\"http://www.themuse.com/advice/best-of-2013-5-ways-to-find-your-passion\">what our purpose might be and wonder just how our work fits in with that picture</a>.</p><p>So simplify it. Take the weight out of it. Taking direction from the dictionary, look at your legacy as something you possess that you can gift to others, by your own free will. Time, consideration, skill, empathy, hospitality, experience—all of these things and more are things you can gift to others.</p><p>Generosity then, is a purpose you can get behind right now, today, this very moment, rather than waiting for an epiphany that may never come.</p><p>Purpose is a funny thing. Sometimes fleeting, sometimes invigorating, sometimes infuriating. But all it really comes down to, especially at work, is the choice to engage with all you\\'ve got rather than struggle with everything you\\'re not.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">\\xa0</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>--Posted: March 26, 2014</em></p>',\n",

So if you want to perform better\\xa0<em>right now</em>, there\\'s only one way: Feel more confident. Everyone\\'s been there. We don\\'t need research to confirm the more confident we feel the better we perform.</p><p>Of course actually finding that dose of confidence, especially when we need it most, is the real trick.</p><p>I\\'ve written about\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-best-way-to-be-more-confident-th.html\" target=\"_blank\">the best way to be more confident</a>\\xa0and ways to get a\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/5-ways-to-instantly-boost-your-confidence.html\" target=\"_blank\">quick jolt of confidence</a>. (As well as some ways to\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/ss/jeff-haden/11-body-positions-and-gestures-that-can-improve-performance\" target=\"_blank\">use body positions and gestures to improve performance</a>.)</p><p>And that\\'s why I love this guest post from\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/author/christina-desmarais\" target=\"_blank\">Christina DesMarais</a>, a writer for Inc.com, Forbes, PCWorld, and the Minneapolis Tribune.</p><p><strong>Here\\'s Christina:</strong></p><p>Whether you have to give a speech, need to negotiate with someone, want to find a mate, or simply\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/7-ways-to-set-yourself-up-for-a-stellar-work-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">get ahead in life</a>, confidence is your best friend. If you\\'re lacking in that regard, here\\'s how to change your thinking or in the very least make it appear as if you\\'re comfortable in your own skin.<br /><br /><strong>1.\\xa0Don\\'t slouch.<br /></strong><br />Regardless of your confidence level, slouching communicates you lack faith in yourself.<br /><br />Try posting a note on the edge of your computer display with a reminder such as an up arrow in thick red marker or the words \"SIT UP STRAIGHT\". To correct yourself, roll your shoulders back and imagine someone just pulled a string from the top of your head, elongating your spine and raising your chin so it\\'s in a neutral, forward-facing position.<br /><br />If you\\'re really serious about improving your posture you could try\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.lumobodytech.com/lumoback/\" target=\"_blank\">LumoBack</a>. It\\'s a $150 sensor you strap around your lower back under your clothes. Every time you slouch it vibrates to remind you to straighten up. The LumoBack app, which works on newer iOS devices, reports on how well you\\'re doing, as well as other activities, such as steps taken, how much time you spend sitting and how many times you stood up in a day.<br /><br /><strong>2.\\xa0Understand that most people aren\\'t thinking about you.<br /></strong><br />Self-conscious people worry too much about\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/5-simple-tips-on-making-a-great-first-impression.html\" target=\"_blank\">what others think about them</a>. The thing is, usually other people aren\\'t thinking about them--at all.<br /><br />Imagine you had the magical power to read the thoughts of the people around you. You know what you\\'d hear a lot of? Stuff like this:</p><p><em>Crap, I forgot to stop by the bank... I shouldn\\'t have eaten that cake Susan brought to work, now I feel fat... I hope Sara flirts with me again tonight at volleyball like she did last week... Why should I have to clean the downstairs bathroom when Bill is the only one in the house who uses it?</em></p><p>Notice how many times \"I\" might pop up? Humans are remarkably self-absorbed.<br /><br /><strong>3.\\xa0Nix negative self-talk.</strong><br /><br />If \"diffident\" describes you well, there\\'s a good chance you\\'re an\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/how-to-stop-overreacting.html\" target=\"_blank\">over-thinker with a lot of negative self-talk</a>\\xa0rolling around in your head.<br /><br />Pay attention to what you\\'re saying to yourself. Every time you think something like \"I can\\'t do this\" replace it with something positive such as \"I\\'m going to give it my best shot.\" The key is to step out of yourself and look at your self-talk as an outsider. How would it make you feel to hear someone sitting next to you say \"I\\'m so [fat, dumb, ugly, slow, etc.]?\" Pretty harsh, right?<br /><br />Nurture yourself within your thought life, just as you might with someone else.<br /><br /><strong>4.\\xa0Lighten up.<br /></strong><br />Some people are naturally\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/the-flip-side-of-negative-emotions.html\" target=\"_blank\">more serious than others</a>. If this is you, learn to smile and laugh more. Even a simple grin will suffice to entice others to want to be around you.<br /><br />To make smiling a habit, set a time when you\\'ll practice doing it for several minutes straight--maybe in the car on your way to work. It will seem weird, but after a while smiling will come more naturally. Studies have also shown that forcing yourself to smile is good for your health, as well.<br /><br />Need help laughing? America\\'s Funniest Home videos work wonders for me, and can easily be streamed online for free. Or why not plug some headphones into your computer and get happy during your lunch break with a comedy channel on YouTube? Or use the \"funny\" filter at Ted.com to watch TED Talks that will get you giggling.<br /><br /><strong>5.\\xa0Handle mistakes with grace.<br /></strong><br />How you handle slip-ups is also important. Confident people understand no one is perfectand however you just screwed up, it\\'s probably not the end of the world.<br /><br />Ask yourself: How important will this mistake seem in three months?<br /><br />If whatever you did involves your work output, acknowledge your flub and vow to do better next time. If your \"mistake\" is only that you said something stupid or tripped over a box in the storage room landing in a mess on the floor, try laughing it off. It\\'s the most gracious way to handle a blunder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>--Published: April 21st, 2014</em></p>',\n",

If you don’t believe in yourself, why should anyone else put their faith in you? To walk with swagger and improve your self-confidence, watch out for these fifteen things highly confident people don’t do:<br /><br /><strong>1. They don’t make excuses.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people take ownership of their thoughts and actions. They don’t blame the traffic for being tardy at work; they were\\xa0<em>late</em>. They don’t excuse their short-comings with excuses like “I don’t have the time” or “I’m just not good enough”; they\\xa0<em>make\\xa0</em>the time and they keep on improving until they\\xa0<em>are\\xa0</em>good enough.<br /><br /><strong>2. They don’t avoid doing the scary thing.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people don’t let fear dominate their lives. They know that the things they are afraid of doing are often the very same things that they\\xa0<em>need\\xa0</em>to do in order to evolve into the person they are meant to be.<br /><br /><strong>3. They don’t live in a bubble of comfort.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people avoid the comfort zone, because they know this is a place where dreams die. They actively pursue a feeling of discomfort, because they know stretching themselves is mandatory for their success.<br /><br /><strong>4. They don’t put things off until next week.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people know that a good plan executed\\xa0<em>today\\xa0</em>is better than a great plan executed\\xa0<em>someday</em>. They don’t wait for the “right time” or the “right circumstances”, because they know these reactions are based on a fear of change. They\\xa0<a title=\"Less Thinking, More Doing: Develop the Action Habit Today\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/less-thinking-more-doing-develop-the-action-habit-today.html\" target=\"_blank\">take action</a>\\xa0here, now, today – because that’s where progress happens.<br /><br /><strong>5. They don’t obsess over the opinions of others.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people don’t get caught up in negative feedback. While they\\xa0<em>do\\xa0</em>care about the well-being of others and aim to make a positive impact in the world, they\\xa0<em>don’t\\xa0</em>get caught up in negative opinions that they can’t do anything about.\\xa0They know that their true friends will accept them as they are, and they don’t concern themselves with the rest.<br /><br /><strong>6. They don’t judge people.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people have no tolerance for unnecessary, self-inflicted drama. They don’t feel the need to insult friends behind their backs, participate in gossip about fellow co-workers or lash out at folks with different opinions. They are so comfortable in who they are that they feel no need to look down on other people.<br /><br /><strong>7. They don’t let lack of resources stop them.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people can make use of whatever resources they have, no matter how big or small. They know that all things are possible with creativity and a refusal to quit. They don’t agonize over setbacks, but rather focus on finding a solution.<br /><br /><strong>8. They don’t make comparisons.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people know that they are not competing with any other person. They compete with no other individual except the person they were yesterday. They know that every person is living a story so unique that drawing comparisons would be an absurd and simplistic exercise in futility.<br /><br /><strong>9. They don’t find joy in people-pleasing.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people have no interest in pleasing every person they meet. They are aware that not all people get along, and that’s just how life works. They focus on the quality of their relationships, instead of the quantity of them.<br /><br /><strong>10. They don’t need constant reassurance.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people aren’t in need of hand-holding. They know that life isn’t fair and things won’t always go their way. While they can’t control every event in their life, they focus on their power to react in a positive way that moves them forward.<br /><br /><strong>11. They don’t avoid life’s inconvenient truths</strong>.</p><p>Highly confident people confront life’s issues at the root before the disease can spread any farther. They know that problems left unaddressed have a way of multiplying as the days, weeks and months go by. They would rather have an uncomfortable conversation with their partner today than sweep an inconvenient truth under the rug, putting trust at risk.<br /><br /><strong>12. They don’t quit because of minor set-backs.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people get back up every time they fall down. They know that failure is an unavoidable part of the growth process. They are like a detective, searching for clues that reveal why this approach didn’t work. After modifying their plan, they try again (<em>but better this time)</em>.<br /><br /><strong>13. They don’t require anyone’s permission to act.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people\\xa0<a title=\"Less Thinking, More Doing: Develop the Action Habit Today\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/less-thinking-more-doing-develop-the-action-habit-today.html\" target=\"_blank\">take action</a>\\xa0without hesitation. Every day, they remind themselves, “If not me, who?”<br /><br /><strong>14. They don’t limit themselves to a small toolbox.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people don’t limit themselves to Plan A. They make use of any and all weapons that are at their disposal, relentlessly testing the effectiveness of every approach, until they identify the strategies that offer the most results for the least cost in time and effort.<br /><br /><strong>15. They don’t blindly accept what they read on the Internet as “truth” without thinking about it.</strong></p><p>Highly confident people don’t accept articles on the Internet as truth just because some author “said so”. They look at every how-to article from the lens of their unique perspective. They maintain a healthy skepticism, making use of any material that is relevant to their lives, and forgetting about the rest. While articles like this are a fun and interesting thought-exercise, highly confident people know that they are the only person with the power to decide what “confidence” means.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>8 Killer Opening Lines To Use At Your Next Networking Event<br />By: <a title=\"Jessica Henderson\" href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/author/jessica_henderson/\">Jessica Henderson</a>\\xa0• Forbes.com\\xa0</p><p><em>This post originally appeared on\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/2014/04/opening-lines-networking/\" target=\"_blank\">LearnVest</a>.</em></p><p>For many people, simply walking into a room full of strangers can be terrifying—let alone one packed with potentially valuable work contacts … and maybe even a future boss.</p><p>But since savvy networking can be one of the best moves you can make for your career, it’s time to learn how to fearlessly bust through the doors of any work event—and own it.</p><p>That’s why we challenged three networking veterans to divulge the clever opening lines that will enable you to strike up a conversation with just about anyone, whether you’re mingling with hundreds of people at a convention center or a more intimate group at an after-work mixer.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #1: “I just tried a slider from the buffet table, and I think I’m going to grab another. Care to join me?”</strong></p><p>Hey, a networker’s gotta eat, right? And if half of the room is as starving as you are after a long day at the office, the action is likely happening over by the food, says Barbara Safani of Career Solvers and the author of “Happy About My Job Search.”</p><p>The best part about this opening line? Once you make it over to the noshes, you can easily—and effortlessly—strike up a conversation with even more people while sampling the hunger-quashing canapés.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #2: “I was just on\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/linkedin/\">LinkedIn</a>\\xa0and saw that we went to the same college.” Or … “I saw on LinkedIn that you also worked with so-and-so!”</strong></p><p>The most effective opening line is something that’s personal to the person, says LinkedIn’s career expert Nicole Williams, who’s also the author of “Girl on Top: Your Guide to Turning Dating Rules into Career Success.”</p><p>And while digging up info on other guests was hard before the advent of LinkedIn, Twitter and other social-networking sites, it’s now easy to find an opener that connects you to a fellow networker. Just ask the event organizer for a list of attendees a few days beforehand, and then do a quick internet search.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #3: “How long have you been a member of this organization?”</strong></p><p>Sometimes less really is more, says Kathleen Brady, a career\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/coach/\">coach</a>\\xa0and the author of “Get a Job! 10 Steps to Career Success.” This simple, open-ended question can work wonders to engage that shy someone who, by virtue of being at the same networking event, is there to meet people just like you. But try not to fire off too many questions at once—you don’t want your conversation to suddenly feel like an interrogation.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #4: “I read your book!” Or … “I was really impressed by the speech you gave at an event last year.”</strong></p><p>According to Williams, there’s no greater compliment than to play up your knowledge of someone and their work. They’re sure to be flattered and eager to hear your opinion of their writing or other accomplishment—and you can even use their talking points as a kicking-off point for an ice-breaker.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #5: “What do you love about your job?”</strong></p><p>This is another simple one-liner—but it’s one of Williams’ favorites. “Whenever someone gets the opportunity to talk about themselves, they not only love it,” she says, “but they also feel closer to you by virtue of your hearing their story.” Bottom line: “The more they’re encouraged to talk about themselves,” she adds, “the more likely they’ll walk away going, ‘I really like that person!’ ”</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #6: “I’ve worked here for several months, but I’ve never been to the penthouse floor before. Great views!”</strong></p><p>According to Brady, disclosing something about yourself from the outset helps to establish vulnerability and approachability, and it will encourage others to do the same. But be careful not to get\\xa0<em>too</em>\\xa0personal—like sharing your real feelings about upper management—because the point isn’t to leave your listener speechless.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #7: “Are you from [insert locale]?”</strong></p><p>This one-liner establishes both a personal and professional connection, says Williams. It’s professional in that your shared industry brought you to the same city or town, and then you can compare notes on how you each arrived at point B from point A in your career.</p><p>And it’s personal because you’re attaching something emotional to the other person’s story by finding out the individual’s hometown and what exactly pulled them to where they are now—effectively helping you reach the\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/next/\">next</a>\\xa0level of conversation.</p><p><strong>Conversation Starter #8: “Did you see all the wacky stuff they’re giving away at the sponsor tables?”</strong></p><p>Do you often find yourself at conferences and expos where overeager organizers have plastered their faces, logos and catchphrases on everything from toothbrushes to fly swatters? Next time, hold up that glow-in-the-dark foam finger for a shared chuckle with the closest attendee, and then lead the way to the table with the best—and most usable—swag.</p><p><strong>Simple Steps to Seal the Networking Deal</strong></p><p>Once you’ve got the conversation going, says Brady, keep the person engaged by playing equal parts listener and engager—and don’t linger too long with any one fellow networker.</p><p>“The goal is to meet as many people as possible, so you have to be tactful about when to break away,” says Williams. “Try excusing yourself to make a quick call. Or pull the person standing next to you into the conversation, so you can make another connection, and then move on as they become immersed in a topic.”</p><p>Of course, none of these killer lines are worth using if you forget the most vital step of networking: the follow-up.</p><p>Instead of exchanging business cards that can be misplaced, “I\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/2014/02/10-apps-that-could-supercharge-your-career/\" target=\"_blank\">use an app</a>\\xa0to request a connection right then and there on LinkedIn,” says Williams. “This way, I can send a note the next day that says, ‘I enjoyed meeting you last night, and this was a great topic.’ And they can then look into you further if they want.”</p><p>But the real benefit of using an electronic follow-up, adds Williams, is that the next time you see an article about something you talked about—be it business-related or something tied to that Thailand trip the other person was taking—you can zap it over to keep the connection going.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>--Posted: 4/22/2014</em></p>',\n",

Neither is it especially helpful to know that athletes perform best after 10 hours of sleep or that\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/i-dont-believe-in-burnout-career-lessons-from-marissa-mayer\">Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer gets so much done</a>\\xa0because she needs only four hours of sleep. Let’s be honest: Not many of us are able to pull off either extreme.</p><p>So for the rest of us—those who want to maintain a high performance and be a role model to others without resorting to caffeine pills, cattle prods, and other unsustainable gimmicks—here are five research-backed ways to keep yourself at peak performance.\\xa0</p><p><strong>1. Arrive at Work in a Good Mood</strong></p><p>Researchers Nancy Rothbard and Steffanie Wilk found that call center representatives in a Fortune 500 company who started the day in a good mood delivered superior results and felt more positive after their calls.\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/what-to-do-when-youre-in-a-serious-rut\">Their colleagues who arrived in a bad mood</a>, on the other hand, suffered a dip in productivity of up to 10%.</p><p>A positive mood lifts your brain’s dopamine levels, resulting in improved cognitive performance. So, build a mood-lifter into your commute, whether it’s listening to music, calling a friend for a virtual coffee chat, watching an uplifting TED talk, or catching a highlight from your favorite late night show, and enjoy the resulting boost in brainpower as you arrive at your desk.</p><p><strong>2. Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time</strong></p><p>When McKinsey &amp; Company\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/leading_in_the_21st_century/centered_leadership_how_talented_women_thrive\">studied the characteristics that drive and sustain top female leaders</a>, energy management was discovered to be a common element of their success. Those leaders understood exactly what drained and sustained them, and I recommend you do the same.</p><p>Keep a log of your energetic peaks and valleys for at least a week, and from those insights, build a new routine. By paying close attention, you may learn to avoid the carb-heavy lunches that make you sleepy by 2 PM or to\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/dealing-with-that-guy-the-coworker-who-rubs-you-the-wrong-way\">connect with a chatty team member early in the day</a>, when you still have the energy to wrangle his or her whimsy.</p><p><strong>3. Expand Your Capacity Like Athletes</strong></p><p>Once you know your energy sources, you can “expand your capacity like elite athletes do,” a strategy advised by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz in\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Full-Engagement-Performance/dp/0743226755/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399492807&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=power+of+full+engagement\"><em>The Power of Full Engagement</em></a>. They recommend approaching a typical workday like an interval training workout by arranging tasks into bursts of intense activity interspersed with breaks or lower-intensity activities.</p><p>What interval works best? K. Anders Ericsson, a psychology professor at Florida State University, found that high performing professionals—like elite athletes and musicians—maximize their performance with 90-minute bursts of activity. So, start there: Work, for example, on that PowerPoint presentation for a frenzied 90 minutes, then shake things up with a stretch break or\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-taking-more-meetings-could-save-your-life\">walking meeting</a>.\\xa0</p><p><strong>4. Be an Energizer</strong></p><p>And once you have all that energy, don’t be stingy with it. Sharing it with others will motivate your team and boost your performance, too. According to\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Power-Social-Networks-Understanding/dp/1591392705/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399494178&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Hidden+Power+of+Social+Networks\"><em>The Hidden Power of Social Networks</em></a>\\xa0by Rob Cross and Andrew Parker, people who energize others are much higher performers, and they’re more likely to be heard and to have their ideas acted upon.</p><p>Just remember, being an energizer is a more subtle skill than being a cheerleading extrovert. Cross and Parker note that “energizers are not entertainers, or even necessarily very charismatic or intense. Rather, they bring themselves fully into an interaction.”</p><p>How exactly do you do that? Communications analytics company Quantified Impressions reported that simply making eye contact establishes an emotional connection with the person you’re speaking with. Want someone to know\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-it-factor-how-to-have-executive-presence-in-a-meeting\">he or she has your undivided attention</a>? Put away your cell phone, lean toward him or her, and make eye contact.\\xa0</p><p><strong>5. Understand Your Goal Orientation</strong></p><p>According to the article “<a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/system/files/A%20social-cognitive%20approach_0.pdf\">A Social-Cognitive Approach to Motivation and Personality</a>” by Carol Dweck and Ellen Leggett, there are two types of goal orientation. People with mastery orientation are motivated by the challenge of learning something new, while people with performance orientation do better when striving for excellence by using their existing skills.</p><p>For example, a mastery-oriented individual who is tasked with improving her help desk metrics might motivate herself with a goal to re-engineer the process for incoming requests and achieve that goal by delving into the latest research and speaking to experts in other organizations. Someone who is performance-oriented, on the other hand, would do better with a goal of lifting metrics 15% above last quarter, working toward that by reviewing individual metrics from prior months, identifying when he performed at his peak, and then replicating those successes while striving to push the bar higher.</p><p>Which type are you? Whichever it is,\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-easiest-way-to-achieve-your-daily-goals\">tailor your goals and how you achieve them</a>\\xa0to suit the style that best motivates you.</p><p>Once you’ve found your personal formula for self-motivation and rejuvenation, you’ll be better prepared to pay it forward and go beyond being a solo star performer who motivates only him or herself. Now you can begin lifting up others as you climb. Ask yourself: How will you motivate those around you?</p>',\n",

There are countless studies that show that interviewers form their impression of you within the first 30 seconds. And if you\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.recruiter.com/i/6-top-ways-job-candidates-fail/\">make a serious mistake</a>\\xa0in this opening phase, you may find it hard to change the interviewer’s first impression.</p><p>But, you don’t have to be a total hostage to the first impression counts phenomena, as you have a second chance to make a stronger and longer lasting impression at the end of the interview. Yes, it’s no coincidence that lawyers spend an inordinate amount of time crafting a powerful and persuasive closing statement at the end of the trial; they know it will have an extremely influential effect on the jury. Similarly, a\\xa0<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xy90vrTuZNQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=last+impressions+count+recency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FwMkk9tDbL&amp;sig=1aHhNjY2g8nU4WR-fmvKgwqYlh4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t9VfU9L9O6KN7Qbi_YCoDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=last%20impressions%20count%20recency&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">study by Luchins\\xa0</a>\\xa0showed that the information presented last was more influential than information presented at the beginning (primacy, recency effect) Yes, they revealed that your opening statements are important in the short term but after a period of time what you presented last is most important.

Ideally, your closing statement would be delivered just before you leave, when the interviewer asks if you have anything else to say. This means that you can be sure it will really be the closing statement and will be foremost in the mind of the interviewers.</p><p>And having secured the stage for your closing statement, your statements should ideally take the following format:</p><p>Initially, start by bullet pointing the main reasons you want the job, and try to show why it’s uniquely appealing to you. For example:</p><blockquote><p>This position is the exact challenge that I have seeking for some time now, because it allows me to combine my supervisory skills, technical skills and personal passion for photography.</p></blockquote><p>And then show them how your skills can address their top priority issues as uncovered during the interview. For example<em>:</em></p><blockquote><p>You made it clear that your top priorities are to bring a greater customer focus and international focus to the operation, and I am sure that my 8 months working in our international client’s office, helping them to integrate their new product, means I am perfectly poised to bring these qualities to your team.</p></blockquote><p>Make sure to trigger the visualization and decision making processes by saying something like, “What will be the next step in the selection process?” and/or\\xa0”When would you like the successful candidate to start?”</p><p>Now, you don’t want to leave a lasting impression of being a bore; so, be precise and concise and close out your side of the interview by\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.recruiter.com/i/the-art-of-the-thank-you-note/\">thanking them</a>\\xa0for taking the time to see you.

Most people shy far from that stress but the successful salesperson must meet these seemingly impassable obstacles with quick, calculated responses, relentless positivity and unbridled drive.\\xa0</p><p>Related:\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229969\">5 Important Business Lessons I Learned From My First Job</a></p><p>Entrepreneurs \\xa0face the same obstacles, whether reviewing their business plan with a potential investor or pitching their product to the owner of the corner store. The sales floor teaches\\xa0five simple lessons that translate into successful entrepreneurial habits.</p><p>1. Persistence- You will face resistance and rejection. Do not let that cloud your vision. Lead with bravery, walk the path you chose with confidence. Speak from a resourceful place of clarity.When you are tired of rejection, revise your approach. Something is not working. Sales is the intricate art of communication, entrepreneurship is the art of improvisation. Plan ahead and think on your feet instead of maintaining a reactive state.</p><p>2. Radical Honesty.\\xa0Denial is the number one reason for failure.\\xa0Speak\\xa0hard truths with a gentle approach. Do not be too hard on yourself or others for making errors. Errors are valuable stepping stones to success. Look to them as guidelines to what doesn\\'t\\xa0work. Be honest. You’ll be glad you were.</p><p>Related:<a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230552\">\\xa0How to Fight Denial and Start Tackling Your Biggest Problems</a></p><p>3. Mastery of Mental State.\\xa0External influences will slip doubt, even fear, into your daily thoughts\\xa0but\\xa0your mind is yours, and yours alone.\\xa0Confidence, confidence, confidence! You have access to thousands of emotions at any given time. Consciously choose the ones that serve your purpose. You will see incredible yields.</p><p>4. Creativity.\\xa0Money is compensation for value given. Constantly use your creativity to propose efficient solutions to problems. This creative process doesn\\'t stop once the sale has been made. If anything, the challenge grows to continually supplement each conversation with value. It takes a lot of dedication and research to truly understand the desires and needs of your consumer or client. Be a diligent student of your industry. People will notice.</p><p>5. Diversity.\\xa0Every\\xa0salesperson will tell you prospecting is undeniably valuable. Continually diversifying your streams of income and clientele secures a more stable future for yourself and your company. If you become complacent in any way, you are likely to lose business. Set aside an hour a day for prospecting potential improvements or new clients. Investing that one hour is crucial to long-term\\xa0success. The only constant in life is change.

       "  'content': '<p>Top 10 Ways to Get People to Read and Respond to Your Emails<br />By:\\xa0Jacqueline Whitmore •\\xa0Entrepreneur.com</p><p>Email is the most frequently used communication tool in business today. It’s easy, fast and you can communicate with others while on the go. Less intrusive than a phone call or a text message, it allows for convenient communication and quick turnaround.</p><p>Most of us receive hundreds of\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/email-marketing\">emails</a>\\xa0a day and so do our clients and customers. That’s the main reason why messages can get lost or ignored in the email shuffle.</p><p>Here are 10 tips to keep in mind if you want to make a good impression and increase the likelihood that your emails will get a response.</p><p>Make your subject line specific.\\xa0Just like you read a headline before deciding to click on an article, recipients evaluate an email’s importance by its subject line. Keep the subject brief, relevant and specific. After meeting someone for the first time, I always try to include their first name in the subject line and how I know them. For example, “Hi Ron, we met at the charity fundraiser last Saturday,” is more eye-catching than, “Following up,” or “Great meeting you.”</p><p>Related:\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234072\">How to Write an Unforgettable Thank-You Note</a></p><p>Keep it brief.\\xa0Most people are time deprived and don’t enjoy reading long and laborious emails. Stick to the topic at hand. If you have a lot of information to discuss, you’ll save time by calling the person instead. For informal communication, it’s more efficient to use the subject line only. “Free for lunch tomorrow?” Then add (EOM) to the end of the subject line — short for “end of message.”</p><p>Include bullet points.\\xa0Whenever you have a list of specific questions, try using bullet points. This will make your email easier to read and easier for the recipient to respond.</p><p>Praise the person.\\xa0When emailing someone you don’t know well or a VIP, it’s helpful to include where you met, who referred you, or how you know that person. For example, when I get an email that reads, “Dear Jacqueline, I enjoyed reading your book,\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Poised-Success-Distinguish-Outstanding-Professionals/dp/0312600321/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401985924&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=poised+for+success\"><em>Poised for Success</em></a>. Please send me more information about your\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.etiquetteexpert.com/speaking_topics.html\">seminars</a>.” I am more apt to respond quicker than if a person writes, “Hi, please send me more information about your\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.etiquetteexpert.com/speaking_topics.html\">seminars</a>.”</p><p>Simmer down.\\xa0It’s important to be aware of how you come across in an email. As the saying goes, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” In other words, think twice before sending a harsh message. If you’re angry, upset or frustrated, take time to cool down. Remember, messages may be copied, forwarded or printed so don’t send anything you might later regret.</p><p>Related:\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233320\">6 Things You Should Never Say During a Speech</a></p><p>Double check for typos.\\xa0Before you click the “send” button, proofread your email. Keep an eye out for errors in grammar, spelling and punctuation. For a more important email, read it aloud to be sure it conveys exactly what you want to say. A poorly composed email can make you appear unprofessional, careless or uneducated.</p><p>Guard email addresses.\\xa0If you must send an email to a large group of people, be sure to respect the privacy of the recipients. If the recipients aren’t acquainted, use the “BCC” option — blind carbon copy. That way, the only email to appear will be that of the sender.</p><p>Don’t abuse the “reply all” feature.\\xa0While the “reply all” feature can be useful, it can also frustrate and anger those who don’t need to receive the reply. Reply only to those who need a response.\\xa0</p><p>Ask permission before sending large attachments.\\xa0Many people loathe having their email bogged down with lots of photos and huge attachments. Get permission from the recipient before sending large files or use a file sharing service such as\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox.com</a>.\\xa0</p><p>Give the recipient time to respond.\\xa0Some people don’t check their email multiple times a day. If you need a quick response, pick up the phone and call or use keywords such as, “PLEASE READ THIS” or “URGENT,” in the subject line to help the recipient identify important messages easily.</p><p>Above all, mind your manners. The most important things are those we learned when we were children. When you ask for something, say ‘please.’\\xa0 When someone gives you something or does something special for you, say ‘thank you.’ Your online reputation is a part of your personal brand. That’s why The Golden Rule never goes out of style: treat others the way you would like to be treated.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>10 Tips for Building Stronger Networks in Work and Life<br />By:\\xa0<a title=\"Author \" href=\"http://www.inc.com/author/deborah-petersen\" target=\"_blank\">Deborah Petersen</a> • Inc.com</p><p>Most people understand that to be successful they need to network. But actually going out and doing it is another matter. People \"are daunted by the task and believe it requires inauthentic, uncomfortable behavior and is an activity that is inconsistent with focusing on job performance,\" says\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/pfeff\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a>, a Stanford professor of organizational behavior, who covers the subject of networking as part of his Paths to Power elective course. Too often, he says, people view networking \"as something that \\'is not them\\' or that they could not see themselves doing.\"</p><p>But in a new e-book coauthored with Ross Walker, a 2005 graduate of Stanford’s MBA program, they argue that networking ability is not just important for career success--\"it is also crucial for getting things accomplished and making change inside organizations in both the public and private sector.\"</p><p>The authors draw on Walker\\'s experience, which was shaped by an \"ability to build relationships and an efficient and effective social network,\" they write. Walker became one of the youngest members to serve on the Stanford Board of Trustees; found a career in his chosen field of real estate, where he has a successful real estate investment fund; holds equity in Hollywood nightclubs; and has a small ownership stake in the Oakland Athletics Major League Baseball team.</p><p>While at Stanford, Walker had a reputation for being a big-tent person. He planned events and theme parties that not only were entertaining but brought people together. These events naturally led to networks that went beyond his time at Stanford, but Walker’s ability to make connections did not stop there, says Pfeffer, who was so impressed that he wrote a<a href=\"https://gsbapps.stanford.edu/cases/detail1.asp?Document_ID=3443\" target=\"_blank\">case study</a>\\xa0charting Walker’s networking efforts.</p><p>They teamed up to write\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/People-Are-Name-Game-Career-ebook/dp/B00CBXCU0M\" target=\"_blank\"><em>People Are the Name of the Game: How to Be More Successful in Your Career--and Life</em></a>. Here are some tips from the book.</p><h3>Face Time Counts</h3><p>Research by University of Chicago professor Ronald Burt shows that \"being even one step removed from the person within the network almost completely reduces the benefits to you,\" the authors write. \"Simply put, networking is not something that can, or should, be outsourced.\"</p><h3>Find a Mutual Connection</h3><p>\"People are the name of the game--you must understand how to read people quickly and find what you have in common,\" says Walker. \"With so much public information out there, this is easier to do today.\" You are more likely to get a response from someone if you have already found a shared interest or acquaintance in advance of introducing yourself.</p><h3>Create a Robust Network</h3><p>Walker was initially interested in working in the hospitality business and through his research learned that alumnus Chip Conley had founded the boutique hotel chain Joie de Vivre Hospitality while he was still in his mid-20s. When Walker finally reached out to Conley, the 1984 Stanford GSB graduate had already heard of him. \"I got hit by three different people simultaneously saying \\'you have to meet Ross Walker,\\'\" Conley recalled, according to the case study. \"All of a sudden, you have him on your radar in a big way.\"</p><h3>Be Specific</h3><p>CEOs are busy people and therefore unlikely to respond to vague requests or take on the burden of trying to help you. Help them help you by making a specific request. For instance, when Walker met Conley, he submitted a brief one-page proposal to Conley asking for an internship and offering to work over the summer without compensation. The reason: \"Walker believed that you could not let high-profile executives think for you … [It is] better to give them something tangible to consider, because once you’ve left their presence, they are not going to spend more time thinking about you.\"</p><h3>Be Diverse</h3><p>Clearly, it is important to link up with the influencers in your intended field. But do not underestimate the importance of \"weak ties.\" It is important to create a diverse network--of people, industries, and locations--even though these connections may seem remote from your present career or contemplated future. Diversity can also help when seeking funding for a startup.</p><h3>Do What You Say You Will</h3><p>\"Do not overpromise and underdeliver, but instead, maintain credibility by doing the follow-up work to always meet your commitments,\" the authors write. \"In financial parlance, it is easier to exceed expectations if those expectations are not completely over the top or in your face.\" By keeping your promises, your reputation will spread throughout your network. \"The action of \\'moving things from A to B\\' or following through as promised builds a surprisingly rare reputation that can be leveraged in a number of ways as it builds the confidence of others,\" write Pfeffer and Walker.</p><h3>Be Genuine</h3><p>The co-authors say that the more you\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/7-business-thinkers.html\" target=\"_blank\">pursue your passion</a>, the more compelling your story will be when you share it with someone either by email or in person.</p><h3>Think Long-term</h3><p>When Walker sought investors for a real estate fund he was creating, his connections led him to a billionaire CEO in Silicon Valley, who asked Walker how much he wanted him to invest. Walker suggested he contribute whatever amount he was comfortable with. \"Walker saw this first fund as building a track record and, in the process, cementing relationships with people who would be \\'with him for a lifetime\\' once they had seen what he could accomplish and gotten comfortable investing together,\" Pfeffer noted.</p><h3>Consider Your Approach</h3><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/5-easy-ways-to-write-better-emails.html\" target=\"_blank\">Crafting emails</a>\\xa0can be an art sometimes,\" Walker notes. \"I always take time to think of the subject line. I try to write something there that reflects a connection. For example, if you are a student and you are contacting an alumnus, I might write ‘Current Stanford GSB Student Inquiry,’ as I know that most alumni enjoy hearing from current students for a number of reasons.\"</p><h3>Stay in Touch and Give Back</h3><p>An easy way to keep in touch with those in your network is to send them emails now and then, introducing them to people who will be helpful additions to their networks. And, like Walker does, respond when others seek to add you to their circles.</p><p><em>This piece was originally published by Stanford Graduate School of Business and is republished with permission.

       "  'content': '<p><strong>10 Surprising Sales Secrets\\xa0</strong><br />By:\\xa0Geoffrey James • Inc.com</p><p>Over the past 15 years, I\\'ve been studying the art of selling. In the process of writing hundreds of articles and columns about selling, I\\'ve been personally coached by nearly 100 top sales gurus. Here are the 10 most surprising things I\\'ve learned from the experience.<em>--<a href=\"http://www.geoffreyjames.com/\">Geoffrey James</a></em></p><div><strong>1. Customers truly want to buy.</strong></div><div><p>Everybody likes to buy things (don\\'t you?) but nobody likes\\xa0<em>to be sold something.</em>That\\'s why it alienates customers whenever you attempt to persuade, convince or manipulate a customer into buying. The point of selling is to help a customer make the best decision, thereby adding additional pleasure to the customer\\'s innate desire to buy.</p><div><strong>2. Elevator pitches never work</strong>.</div><div><p>I don\\'t know where this \"elevator pitch\" bullsh*t started, but there\\'s no quicker way to bore a potential customer than to launch into a two or three minute spiel about yourself, your company, and your products. Think about it: do you enjoy listening to other people go on and on and on about\\xa0<em>their</em>\\xa0corporate \"stuff\"?</p><div><strong>3. Cold calling makes you stronger.</strong></div><div><p>Even professional salespeople often hate cold-calling and will do almost anything to get out of it. Even so, calling people you don\\'t know to see if you can help them is one of the best ways in the world to strengthen the emotional muscles that allow you to deal with \"rejection\" and to quickly build rapport and empathy.</p><div><strong>4. Selling is mostly listening.</strong></div><div><p>The challenge of selling is to get the customer talking, not talking to the customer. How can you possibly figure out whether you can help a customer, or how to help that customer, if your mouth is moving? Let the customer have the pleasure of dominating the conversation.</p><div><strong>5. Sales training can\\'t create sales stars.</strong></div><div><p>Your bullsh*t detector should go on red alert whenever you\\'re told that sales training can make everyone on the sales team into a top performer. Sales training can improve performance marginally, but it can\\'t turn an average performer into a sales star any more than great coaching can turn a weekend hoop shooter in a Lebron James.</p><div><strong>6. Introverts usually outsell extroverts.</strong></div><div><p>The stereotype of the outgoing, fast-talking, go-getter salesperson is still alive in popular culture, but in the real world that kind of hard-sell attitude and patter makes customers want to puke. Since selling is mostly listening, it favors introverts who can put their egos aside and keep their ears open.</p><div><strong>7. Customer experience creates a brand.</strong></div><div><p>Big companies often spend millions on \"branding\" and even small companies are sometimes obsessed with naming, slogans, logos, and so forth. What a waste! Your \"brand\" is how your customers feel about you, which is\\xa0<em>always</em>a result of the experience they have when dealing with you. Within that experience, the minutiae of \"branding\" plays a distinctly minor role.</p><div><strong>8. Closing is a process not an event.</strong></div><div><p>Contrary to popular belief, there isn\\'t (or shouldn\\'t be) a single point in time where you \"ask for the business.\" If your purpose is to truly help a customer make the best decision and you\\'ve done your best to accomplish that, you\\'ll find the conversation gradually move from \"what if\" to \"when\" if the best decision is to buy from you.</p><div><strong>9. Loyal customers are better than new ones.</strong></div><div><p>Getting new customers to buy from you is expensive and chancy. Getting existing customers to buy from you is inexpensive and easy. Getting loyal customers to buy from you costs nothing and is automatic. Therefore, your priority should always be to transform existing customers into loyal ones; new customers are only a priority when you\\'re just starting out.</p><div><strong>10. Everybody sells.</strong></div><div><p>While some people do sell for a living (they\\'re called salespeople), there\\'s not a single person in the business world--from CEO to mailroom drone--who is not constantly selling the value of his or her contribution. Unless your job description is something like \"gaze at my own navel,\" you\\'re selling. Take my word on it.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">\\xa0</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>',\n",

Not only do you have to track individual tasks during the day, but you\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-easiest-way-to-see-exactly-how-productive-you-are\">probably have an app on your phone or online that helps you</a>. How can anyone possibly stay on top of it all?</p><p>As work gets more granular, it’s even more important to get smarter about how you handle your day. Say you need to plan a business trip. There was a time when you might have just bought the tickets, made the hotel reservation, and alerted the staff verbally.</p><p>Today, you have to post a message about your plans on Twitter, gather up all of your devices and chargers, make sure the hotel has that one VGA adapter you need for your presentation, and do countless other tasks. Beyond that, you still have to learn how to use a new smartphone and post your presentation to an online portal. Everything takes time. Here’s how to manage it better.</p><p><strong>1. Do the Hardest Tasks First</strong></p><p>Here’s an obvious one that you’ve probably seen before, but it works. When you start your day, take a quick look at what is facing you. The hardest task is the one that will slow you down the most and also the one that will zap the most energy. Say it’s learning a new desktop app the company is rolling out for every employee. If you save it for later, you’ll keep thinking about the challenge. Finish the most difficult task first. Your day will go much smoother, paving the way for the easier projects.</p><p><strong>2. Offer to Help the Most Productive Co-Workers</strong></p><p>Collaboration is the key to being highly productive. But how can you kickstart the process? First, try to find the employee who is working the hardest in the office.\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-right-way-to-ask-for-help-at-work\">Offer to help with a task</a>. (Make sure you don’t have any ulterior motives about it—be genuine about wanting to assist.) Your co-worker might help you when you get stuck. It’s the golden rule of productivity in business: Help others and they will help you. And, by the way, this rule applies equally to folks in the office and to remote workers.</p><p><strong>3. Finish What You Start</strong></p><p>Here’s another obvious tip, one that’s easy to forget because we all get so busy and try to multitask throughout the day. When you start something, you use up some mental and physical energy trying to gain momentum. (The same physics are at work if you start a 100-meter dash.) If you just finish the task, you don’t have to try and start it again. As an example, if you decide to find those chargers for your next trip, find them all. If you keep looking for them throughout the day, the task will become even more Herculean.</p><p><strong>4. Stop Working on Something When You Reach a Dead End</strong></p><p>While it is important to carry a worthwhile task to completion, you also have to know when a task is not going to pan out. Let’s say you start a business presentation that is making a point about Millennial buying habits. You keep tweaking the chart, and then realize the data is all wrong. It’s best to ditch the presentation altogether and find a new angle. The productivity superstars know when to abandon a task that will never go anywhere.</p><p><strong>5. Resist the Urge to Call for Help Early</strong></p><p>Being highly productive means you know how to persevere through anything. If you start to falter on a task, just keep plowing ahead. Here’s why. When you press hard and finish something, you learn a lot about how to finish things when they get complicated, and that helps you the next time you hit a wall. In the example of learning how to use a new smartphone, don’t call tech support or your friend across town. Learn how to use it on your own—it teaches you how to be autonomous.</p><p><strong>6. Ignore Office Chatter</strong></p><p>Being productive has its own rewards—when you accomplish something, there’s a tangible feeling of self-worth. Don’t trade those benefits for a little office gossip. It’s important to\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-ways-to-actually-focus-in-an-open-office\">keep focused on your work</a>—grinding through any frustrations or distractions. At the same time, don’t forget to build relationships with co-workers, encourage others to excel, and even go for a brisk walk to get the synapses firing again. Don’t confuse a healthy distraction at work for wasting time.</p><p><strong>7. Watch the Squirrel Moments</strong></p><p>Speaking of distractions, here’s the ultimate productivity killer. You may remember the dog in the movie\\xa0<em><a href=\"http://movies.disney.com/up\">Up</a></em>. He would get distracted and say “squirrel!” during a conversation, and we all know people like that. There are good distractions that can re-direct your efforts, but most distractions just derail you. It’s best to weed them out as much as possible. Get a good pair of headphones, find a quiet place to work, and dig in for a few hours to finish a task. Save the squirrel moments for your off-work hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',\n",

However, while you might have a\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/article/2014-05/how-job-recruiters-screen-you-linkedin\">LinkedIn profile</a>, odds are you aren\\'t truly maximizing the power of this vital social network.<br /><br />Here are 13 ways to spend more time on LinkedIn for the best career results:<br /><br /><strong>1. Complete your LinkedIn profile</strong>. Only\\xa0<a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/infographic-linkedin-user-statistics-network-profiles-groups-applications/\" target=\"_blank\">50.5 percent of users have \\'complete profiles\\'</a>\\xa0as defined by LinkedIn. That\\'s right. Only one out of two users have set up their profiles properly.<br /><br />That means, half of LinkedIn\\'s users aren\\'t getting the results they would like (such as calls from recruiters about job opportunities), because they haven\\'t taken the time to understand what should be on their profile.<br /><br /><strong>2. Join professional groups on LinkedIn.</strong><a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/infographic-linkedin-user-statistics-network-profiles-groups-applications/\" target=\"_blank\">The majority of LinkedIn users are in 10 or more groups</a>. Roughly 10 percent of users are a member of the maximum 50 groups.<br /><br />When you are in\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/article/2014-05/how-job-recruiters-screen-you-linkedin\">LinkedIn groups</a>, you can access peers who are part of your industry, skill set or geographic area. Groups make networking so much easier than having to start a conversation with a total stranger.<br /><br /><strong>3. Make LinkedIn connections.</strong><a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/infographic-linkedin-user-statistics-network-profiles-groups-applications/\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0LinkedIn adds two new members per second</a>. With so many people joining, it\\'s only a matter of time before the professionals you most want to connect with have profiles, letting you can make new career connections all over the world.<br />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0<br /><strong>4. Choose your words carefully.\\xa0</strong><a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats/#.U8Z4WvldUdo\" target=\"_blank\">The most used adjective in LinkedIn profiles in 2013 was \"responsible.\"</a>Knowing what words to avoid on your LinkedIn profile can help you avoid looking like everyone else. Plus, studies show that overused subjective words in your profile are a total turnoff to recruiters.<br /><br /><strong>5. Time your updates.\\xa0</strong><a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats/#.U8Z4WvldUdo\" target=\"_blank\">Only 8 percent of Americans use LinkedIn during work hours.\\xa0</a>Studies show that most LinkedIn users hop on early in the morning (between 8 and 10 am) and later at night (5 to 8 pm). Following those patterns with your updates can help you attract maximum attention to your profile, helping you earn the respect and trust of your connections.<br /><br /><strong>6. Use LinkedIn endorsements to increase your visibility.</strong><a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats/#.U8Z4WvldUdo\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0LinkedIn has facilitated more than 1 billion endorsements among members</a>. Endorsements help LinkedIn decide who shows up in the top of search results within its platform. The more\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/article/2013-01/how-make-most-linkedin-endorsements\">LinkedIn endorsements\\xa0</a>you have for a particular skill set, the more views your profile will get.<br /><br /><strong>7. Network\\xa0<em>before</em>\\xa0you need a job</strong>.\\xa0<a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats/#.U8Z4WvldUdo\" target=\"_blank\">There are 100 million LinkedIn users in the U.S</a>. That\\'s a lot of professionals you could be connecting with. Remember,\\xa0<em>every</em>\\xa0job is temporary. Starting to\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/article/2014-07/4-tips-networking-change-fields\">build your network</a>\\xa0after you lose the job is poor planning.<br /><br /><strong>8. Go global.</strong><a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats/#.U8Z4WvldUdo\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0Worldwide LinkedIn has 300 million users.</a>\\xa0Making connections in other parts of the world can expand your knowledge and cultural awareness.<br /><br /><strong>9. Be present.</strong>\\xa0While 48 percent of users<a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/11/4/15_Stats_LinkedIn.html\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0spend fewer than two hours\\xa0</a>on LinkedIn per week, that\\'s still enough to be worth your time and gives you an opportunity to connect with those in our space who could enrich your network.<br /><br /><strong>10. Connect to companies on their favored platform</strong>.<a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/11/4/15_Stats_LinkedIn.html\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0LinkedIn is now responsible for a staggering 64 percent of all visits from social media channels to corporate websites</a>. In contrast, Facebook accounts for 17 percent of such visits, while Twitter is just 14 percent.<br /><br />Businesses are realizing the\\xa0<em>huge</em>\\xa0potential LinkedIn has to drive consumers and potential hires to their sites. Not understanding how LinkedIn will play a future role in your company\\'s success is short-sighted.<br /><br /><strong>11.</strong>\\xa0<strong>Understand how different types of people use LinkedIn</strong>.\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/11/4/15_Stats_LinkedIn.html\" target=\"_blank\">Top level executives primarily use LinkedIn for industry networking (22 percent) and promoting their businesses (20 percent).</a>\\xa0Middle-management professionals primarily use LinkedIn to keep in touch with other people (24 percent) and industry networking (20 percent). Entry-level employees primarily use LinkedIn for job searches (24 percent) and co-worker networking (23 percent).<br /><br />Understanding how people at different levels in their career are using LinkedIn can help you manage your own efforts better. From designing your LinkedIn profile, to reaching out and asking strangers to connect, it\\'s important to realize how others are using LinkedIn and leverage that knowledge to your advantage.<br /><br /><strong>12. Build your network.</strong><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2014/05/04/new-research-2014-linkedin-user-trends-and-10-top-surprises/\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0More than 40 percent of people now report 500+ connections, up from 30 percent in 2013.</a>\\xa0A full 15 percent now have more than 1,000 LinkedIn connections, nearly double last year\\'s 8 percent.<br /><br />Thinking about the theory of \"six degrees of separation,\" it\\'s only a matter of time before you can connect with anyone you want, but only if you have developed your network to a size where you can tap into the power of second- and third-level connections.<br /><br /><strong>13. Join the conversation.</strong><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2014/05/04/new-research-2014-linkedin-user-trends-and-10-top-surprises/\" target=\"_blank\">\\xa0Posting individual status updates as a favorite feature rose 10 percent to 39 percent this year according to Forbes.</a>\\xa0LinkedIn users are contributing more via long and short posts, comments, etc. This helps you to better understand each professional.<br /><br />You are what you contribute. Joining in the conversation gives you the chance to deepen your connections.<br /><br />Like it or not, social media has taken over career development. So you must engage in tools like LinkedIn to stay employable and reach your professional goals. Better to invest time each week now then to be viewed as someone who is out-of-touch.<br /><br /><em>J.T.

       "  'content': '<p>The purpose of this column is to explain how to use a standard reference check as a marketing and/or recruiting opportunity for you and your recruiting firm. While some firms outsource their reference checks to third party agencies or to their clients themselves, for those who prefer to check references directly, I offer some key strategies for obtaining new clients and new candidates at the same time.</p><p>Typically, recruiters who check references have a single goal in mind — to check the reference (and hope that it is positive!). After reading this column, I recommend that you consider having two additional goals:</p><ol><li>Try to gain a new client;</li><li>Try to recruit the reference source.</li></ol><p>Aggressive? Perhaps. Effective? Definitely.</p><h3>Connect With Decision-Makers</h3><p>Historically, reference checks were viewed as a necessary evil in the due diligence process irrespective of who conducted them. In my 20+ years of recruiting, I never knew anyone who particularly enjoyed reference checking until I learned that it was one of the easiest and best ways to reach key decision-makers in an organization with a minimum of resistance.</p><p>Undeniably, one of the greatest frustrations a recruiter has is to be able to speak directly to potential hiring authorities. Traditionally, many reference checkers are simply routed to HR. for a generic and worthless “name, rank, serial number” conversation.</p><h3>Get Names, Phone Numbers</h3><p>When you request references from a candidate, you should ask for names of their direct supervisors, as well as other individuals in the company with whom they worked closely. The benefit of such references are obvious — you, as the reference checker, will be able to get a true sense of the candidate’s abilities and experience, as well as being able to market your services (at the same time) to those individuals who can benefit from a recruiting relationship with you.</p><p>As another tip, I recommend getting the candidate to give you the reference’s direct dial number, or, ideally, their cell phone number (only with the reference’s permission). You want to ensure that you have direct communication with the reference source if at all possible.</p><p>Once you connect with the reference, the key to creating new value is to focus on building rapport quickly, and asking relevant open-ended questions. While your first and foremost goal is to conduct a proper and complete reference check for your client, you should also create valuable communication opportunities to learn about the reference source’s company and personal background, experience and career goals. Aside from the traditional reference check questions, here are some other sample questions that can help facilitate this two-way rapport building:</p><ul><li>How long did you and the candidate work together? During that time, what was your job title/position?</li><li>Did you enjoy working with the candidate? If so, why? If not, why?</li><li>How long have you been with your current company? Where were you before?</li><li>What is your professional background and experience?</li><li>What did you like most about the candidate’s skills?</li><li>What did you like the most about the candidate’s personality?</li><li>In your experience, what type of person works best on your team? How does the candidate rank historically with others that have held the same position?</li><li>What did you do when the candidate left your company? Did you hire someone else? How was that process for you?</li></ul><h3>‘You’ and ‘Your’ Builds Rapport</h3><p>In all these questions, notice that all of them include the word “you” and “your”. The reason for this is simple — you are obtaining information that is directly important to the reference themselves and requires their direct input. This gives you a bridge to discuss other topics such as their current position, their satisfaction, their goals, etc.</p><p>At all times, be professional, listen carefully and determine if they are “opening the window” for you to market yourself and your services. If you sense that there is not an opportunity to do so, nothing is lost. But if there is a chance for enhanced communication, then, by all means, do it.</p><p>I would research the reference source before making the call. For example, if they have a company bio online, a LinkedIn profile or other public information, you might find rapport building items you can use. If possible, I would also ask my candidate to tell you about the reference’s personality, interests, hobbies, and likes in an effort to build a genuine and sincere rapport as quickly as possible. In all events, I would make sure to leave the reference my contact information and/or promotional material via their private/personal email “just in case” they want to reach out to me in the future.</p><p>The harsh realities of today’s marketplace dictate trying new and innovative strategies to build our business and reference checking as a marketing tool should be seriously considered. Good luck!</p><h6>Photo courtesy of\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.bigstockphoto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BigStockPhoto.com</a></h6>',\n",

And it\\'s more than just the size of a bank account or the number of customers for a new mobile app.\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/the-most-important-success-and-happiness-rules-you-can-learn-from-my-mom.html\">Success</a>\\xa0is an attribute. You can learn how to\\xa0<em>act\\xa0</em>successful, and you can also\\xa0<em>be\\xa0</em>successful as a person. Here\\'s how.</p><h2>1. Become a multitasking superhero.</h2><p>We all know people who seem to be able to do a thousand things at once, and they make it seem effortless. They are\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/how-to-become-a-productivity-superstar-7-tips.html\">productivity superstars</a>. That\\'s what it takes to\\xa0<em>be\\xa0</em>a success. You have to learn how to multitask as though you are spinning plates, herding cats, and running a circus all at the same time. That means paying attention to marketing, sales, innovation, invoicing, and everything else. Often, the difference between success and failure is getting stuck on one or two tasks and not making any more progress. Having an attribute of success means getting past the hurdles.</p><h2>2. Capture your lightbulb moments and make them real.</h2><p>Success is the result of an idea made into reality. For example, you figure out how to make an app that\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/\">captures employee feedback</a>\\xa0or you design a\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/models\">new battery for an electric car</a>\\xa0that goes farther than anyone ever imagined. The main difference between failure and success is in how you capture the idea and then how you act on it. You need to do both. I\\'m convinced we all can harness ideas.

However, if your goal is to\\xa0<em>be</em>a success and not just act on an idea, eventually you have to learn how to take the idea and turn it into something worthwhile. Then repeat. Then repeat again. Many people have thought about starting a social network; Mark Zuckerberg learned how to capture the idea, nurture it, and turn it into something. Many people thought about making a home-brew computer; Steve Jobs acted on the idea and turned it into one of the most important companies of our time.</p><h2>3. Always carry a concept through to completion.</h2><p>The third-most important attribute for anyone who wants to\\xa0<em>be</em>\\xa0a success? You have to finish what you start. Never give up. This is really a matter of\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/one-attribute-successful-entrepreneurs-always-possess.html\">perseverance</a>, which is the most important characteristic of all if you want to start a company. Think of it like this. Anyone can start a race; not everyone can finish. Anyone can think of an idea; not everyone can make it become a real product or service. Successful people know how to conceptualize<em>and</em>\\xa0build something from scratch. They are experts at both. If you really want to experience radical, life-altering, brain-twisting, world-dominating success, you have to stick with an idea until the only option left is success.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>I walked into the kitchen as the sun was rising above the water. My friend--let\\'s call him Ray--was sitting at an oversized harvest table sipping a coffee made from a machine that costs more than a small car.</p><p>The kitchen was complete with every trinket befitting a cashed-out entrepreneur. It was one of probably 20 rooms in a 7,000-square-foot mansion perched above 150 feet of waterfront.\\xa0I had been invited to stay at Ray\\'s family home for a few days while passing through on vacation.</p><p>Gobsmacked by the setting, and without thinking very much, I asked Ray, \"Do you still appreciate this view every morning?\"</p><p>\"Every single morning,\" he said.</p><p>\"Really?\" I probed, thinking that even an amazing view like the one I was witnessing would become old after a while.</p><p>\"Yes, really. It may sound corny, but the overwhelming feeling I get when I look out over the water in the morning is gratitude. I feel so lucky to have two healthy kids and a great wife, and to live in this house.\"</p><p><b>Grateful vs. Proud</b></p><p>Ray\\'s use of the word \"grateful\" struck me as a noteworthy response from a successful entrepreneur for whom luck played very little part in his success. To me, saying you are \"grateful\" for something implies that you have been, at least in part, the recipient of good fortune.</p><p>For example, I\\'m \"grateful\" that it\\'s sunny outside as I write this column; I\\'m \"grateful\" to live in a country where we enjoy a relatively high standard of living; I feel \"grateful\" to have had loving and supportive parents. But these are not things I had any control over or for which I can take credit.</p><p>Yet here was Ray, a successful guy saying he was \"grateful\" for what he has. Ray could have chosen to use the word \"proud\" or \"happy,\" which would have implied he felt a sense of satisfaction for achieving his goals. But he didn\\'t.</p><p>Ray did well in school, earned a Stanford MBA, joined a technology company, then started his own business, which was acquired for millions by a public company. I\\'m sure some of Ray\\'s old high school friends would say he has been \"lucky.\"</p><p>But for Ray, luck had little to do with it. It wasn\\'t luck that got him the grades to get into Stanford; it wasn\\'t luck that he started a successful business; and it wasn\\'t by chance that Ray\\'s company was acquired.</p><p><b>The Happiness Paradox: Gratitude\\xa0<em>and</em>\\xa0Self-determination</b></p><p>And therein lies one of the paradoxes I\\'ve come across when studying winning entrepreneurs: The most successful ones leave nothing to chance and at the same time live with a sense of gratitude for how lucky they have been.</p><p>Do you see the inherent paradox in that statement?\\xa0The most successful people feel gratitude for the luck they have received, yet never lose the sense of self-determination required for an entrepreneur to persevere in his or her darkest hour.</p><p>You probably know lots of people who think \"fate\" determines their life. They are the same individuals who feel \"lucky\" when something good happens and \"unlucky\"--or victimized--when something bad happens. They buy lottery tickets, quit easily, and they look enviously at people who achieve things. They are probably your\\xa0<em>least</em>\\xa0successful friends.</p><p><b>Pride Without Gratitude Is a Recipe for Misery</b></p><p>But self-determination on its own is not enough to make you truly happy either. You probably know people who believe work, not fate, controls their destiny. They believe they have earned their big house on the hill and deserve what they have acquired, and it is hard to feel grateful for something you think you deserve in the first place.</p><p>The happiest people I know are able to live in a paradox: They leave nothing to chance but they feel truly grateful for what they have accomplished.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>You\\'ve successfully completed the interview stage and have been offered the job. You’ve negotiated a package you are happy with and now it’s time to start thinking about your exit strategy. You arrange a meeting with your boss and start planning your resignation.</p><p>How do you approach the subject? You start explaining your decision process and how you’ve decided to leave the company to go to another opportunity. Then your boss surprises you with a counteroffer. Your current employer explains how you were just about the get that promotion they’ve been promising, alongside the overdue a pay rise and more responsibility you have requested. You’re the only person who can make the final decision. Will you stay or will you go?</p><p>Counteroffer</p><p>What happens if your employer gives you a counteroffer once you’ve decided to leave? If the only time you get a better deal is when you resign, I’d say there’s a message there. It’s very easy to fall back into your comfort zone and of course, your employer doesn\\'t want you to leave, but if they really didn\\'t see this coming then alarm bells should be ringing — they’re obviously out of sync with the market and you should be questioning why you were not recognised on merit.</p><p>Receiving such an offer, although it’s flattering, shouldn\\'t always be viewed as a vote of confidence. Do they really want to hold onto you because you are a valued member of staff? Or do they view your pay increase as a cost saving against the price of recruiting? If your managers\\' success is measured on staff retention, their reasons for providing a counteroffer may be completely selfish rather than what’s best for the company or for your career.</p><p>Think about your reasons for leaving. Nine times out of ten when you go for an interview, it’s more than just the money that you’re not satisfied with. Perhaps your current role isn\\'t challenging enough, perhaps you feel you don’t have enough autonomy, or maybe your relationship with colleagues is dwindling. My 30 years’ experience has taught me that most people who decide to accept the counteroffer and stay where they are end up leaving six months later. It’s always about more than just the money.</p><p>Because you have shown that you are willing to leave, your loyalty will always be questioned. You could be putting yourself in a vulnerable position where you could be blamed if something goes wrong in the future. Every doctors or dentist appointment going forward may be treated with suspicion. You also have to accept the possibility that you’ll never feel a part of the ‘inner circle’ again and it may be tough to overcome the stigma with colleagues who might resent the new deal you have negotiated for yourself.</p><p>Typically, counteroffers are usually nothing more than a stalling technique to give your employer more time to replace you. The reasons you wanted to leave in the first place will still remain, they just become a little more bearable in the short term because of the pay rise and promotion offered. Will you need to threaten to leave every time you want to negotiate a pay rise or take on more responsibility?</p><p>The biggest taboo in accepting a counteroffer, is that you have broken your commitment to the prospective employer you worked so hard to impress. After negotiating your salary and going through the motions of joining a new team, breaking this commitment could burn all bridges with that prospective employer. Depending on the process and whether any recruiters were involved, you may also gain a reputation for time wasting and behaving unprofessionally. If the counter offer is tempting you to stay, think long and hard about the implications for your reputation within the industry you work in and for your long term career.</p><p>If you do decide to stay, you need to treat it as a formal process. Sometimes employers will promise a better package and encourage you to change your mind and then change nothing. All of a sudden you’re back where you started, but without a job offer. You don’t need to put yourself in this position and must ensure you get all agreements signed and agreed before letting your prospective employer down.</p><p>Reputable businesses rarely make counteroffers, they will accept your resignation with regret, appreciate the contribution you have made to the business and wish you every success for the future. At some point in every career there comes a time to take on a new challenge and leave a business. Reduce the potential career damage and stress levels associated with this transition by having the confidence to trust your gut and stick with your decision.</p><p>Hopefully you make the right decision and continue planning your exit strategy!</p><h2><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">James Caan -\\xa0</span><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-handle-counteroffer-james-caan-cbe\\xa0</span></h2>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>Today’s recruiters are faced with many challenges specifically when it comes to working with candidates. From a candidate accepting a counter offer to withholding information about which companies they’re interviewing with, recruiters know how to identify and resolve potential issues from the get-go.</p><div><p><strong>Challenge 1: The Counter Offer.\\xa0</strong>Often, candidates receive counter offers from their existing employer once they’ve announced their resignation from a role. Candidates can be drawn back in by offers of a higher salary, extra vacation time or a promise for a promotion. Unfortunately, they’re quick to forget why they were looking to leave in the first place – which could be any number of reasons, such as\\xa0disapproval of management style to slow career progression to lack of work-life balance. Ultimately, counter offers are almost always bad news for candidates and recruiters alike.</p><p>To avoid the plight of the counter offer, have an open conversation about the possibility of such a situation with your candidate early on. Ensure the candidate is firm in why they want to leave their current company. At the same time, it’s important to understand what would entice them to stay. Once the counter offer is on the table, recruiters must recognize how emotionally difficult this decision is for the candidate. Help them evaluate this decision with a clear head by reminding them of what factors pushed them away from their job and what’s pulling them towards a new one.</p><p><strong>Challenge 2: The Poor Communicator.\\xa0</strong>Poor lines of communication can spell disaster for the recruiter-candidate relationship. Whether the candidate takes weeks to return emails, rarely answers calls or constantly reschedules meetings, there’s a clear issue in need of a resolution. Have an honest conversation with your candidate and get to the root of the problem. This is a two-way partnership with each party relying on the other. If both parties want to be successful, communication is key. It’s important, too, that candidates understand their communication style with a recruiter might impact how their future employer views them.</p><p><strong>Challenge 3: The Unrealistic Expectations.\\xa0</strong>Avoid dealing with unrealistic demands down the road by establishing realistic expectations early on. On day one, explain how your organization works, what the recruiting process looks like and what your candidate should expect. In return, your candidate should articulate exactly what they’re looking for in terms of company atmosphere, compensation and benefits. If their demands seem unrealistic, use your expertise to establish more realistic expectations. Also, be sure your candidate feels comfortable declining positions they don’t see as a fit. Not only will this prevent candidates from rejecting offers, but it helps the recruiter provide roles more aligned with their needs.</p><p><strong>Challenge 4: The Under-Sharer. \\xa0</strong>Occasionally, recruiters come across candidates who are uncomfortable disclosing information about their job search. Unfortunately, there’s a common misconception among candidates, who might believe recruiters will contact the company they’re interested in and offer up different candidates. Work through this challenge by building a rapport and demonstrating you have their best interest in mind. Not only will this information prevent recruiters from accidently double submitting resumes, but it helps them understand the types of companies and positions their candidates are most interested in. Transparency not only strengthens the recruiter-candidate relationship, but it allows the recruiter to advocate for their candidates and invest in their job search.</p><p>Link to article:</p><p>http://www.thestaffingstream.com/2015/05/05/sealing-the-deal-4-candidate-challenges-and-how-to-overcome-them/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheStaffingStream+%28The+Staffing+Stream%29\\xa0</p></div>',\n",

       "  'content': '<div><p>I need a bigger market! Ever hear that? Ever say it yourself? Usually this request comes from struggling to get enough qualified prospects into the sales pipeline. More often than not, this isn’t due to a lack of potential prospects. Quite the opposite is usually the case – you have way too many prospects!</p><p>Let’s consider the concept of prospect “touches” and why having too many is actually hurting your sales. A couple of key stats to consider:</p><p>In 2007 it took an average of 3.68 cold call attempts to reach a prospect. Today it takes 8 attempts. (Source: TeleNet and Ovation Sales Group study)<br />Only 2% of cold calls result in an appointment (Source: Leap Job)<br />On average, it takes 13 touches to land a new client (source: Microsoft)<br />So if we take this data and apply it to a sales person that has 1000 potential prospects they are working on, it would take them 8,000 cold calls to reach all of their prospects, and 13,000 touches to run each prospect through the sales process. If that sales person had 200 activities a week focused solely on these 1000 prospects, it would take 5 weeksbefore they touched each contact a second time, 40 weeks before they talked to them on the phone, and well over a year before they made a sale. The problem isn’t lack of prospects – its that you can’t get to them frequently enough to warm them up!</p><p>That is why you see in the chart below that half of sales people give up after the first touch, two-thirds give up after 2 touches and almost all (89%) give up after 4 touches. Its like competing in a 100-yard dash and almost everyone gives up after 30 yards.</p></div><div><p><img alt=\"Prospect_Chart\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/414710/Prospect_Chart.png?t=1442235866093\" /></p><p>So the key isn’t to have an unlimited supply of prospects, but rather to identify prospects that are most likely to be clients based on the type of business, skill sets needed, where they are located, their reputation in the market, and other factors. I recommend having no more than 300 of these “suspects” at any given time that you can qualify. Once they have been qualified, you should keep a group of about 75-100 prospects that you are actively staying in contact with. As you make progress with this group, they will become targets that are in your actual sales pipeline (or funnel). These are the best few (about 20-30 is ideal) that you have the best chance of closing and should focus additional time on.</p><p>How do you divide your time with this group? Well, that depends on how long you’ve been in your sales role and how developed your pipeline is. Early on, you will be focused primarily on qualifying suspects, so you should touch each of them as much as weekly. As you start to qualify these companies, your focus will shift more heavily towards prospects, and ultimately targets. Once you have filled your suspect-prospect-target list, you will have about 430 total companies you are focused on. If you touch suspects monthly, prospects bi-weekly, and targets weekly, it results in the following:</p><p>300 suspects monthly = 75 weekly touches<br />100 prospects bi-weekly = 50 weekly touches<br />30 targets weekly = 30 weekly touches<br />This is a total of about 155 touches a week. Touches should be a combination of calls, emails, LinkedIn inmails, direct mail, and other sales activities. Your approach should be varied. Creating a 13-week touch campaign is a great way to ensure that you contact your prospects enough times to give yourself the best chance for success.</p><p>Remember, by consistently focusing on 300 suspects, 75-100 prospects, and 20-30 targets, you will be more focused and able to hit that number of 13 touches. Meanwhile, your competition is giving up after 2 or 3 attempts.</p><p>Link to article:</p><p>http://blog.tallannresources.com/blog/prospecting-shrink-your-universe-sell-more-business</p></div>',\n",

       "  'content': '<header><p>Dear Barbara:</p><p>Over the past two quarters, I feel like I’ve lost my ability to match my candidates to orders. They tell me one thing and then during interviews with my clients they give different answers. My clients are beginning to lose their confidence in me and i find myself second guessing who I’m now submitting. Do you have any advice on how I can make better matches?</p><p>Stephen C., Boston</p><p>Dear Stephen:</p><p>To help you improve your matching skills, I’ve listed below the seven most common mistakes — and what to do to avoid them.</p><p>1. Having selective hearing – ignoring red flags</p><p>When you hear red flags you must hit them head on. Red flags just don’t disappear; they actually become more prevalent throughout the placement process.</p><p>2. Interview with a specific opportunity in mind</p><p>If you interview with a specific job in mind, you will slant your interview questions. Conduct a general interview to understand what is really most important to each candidate.</p><p>3. Not understanding job specs</p><p>Before you attempt to match your candidate, it is important you understand the job specs to be able to explain and present them to your candidates.</p><p>4. Not listening to understand</p><p>In order to make appropriate matches, it is important to listen and understand where your candidates are coming from vs. Listening to solve. If you see the opportunity through the eyes of your candidate, you will make better matches.</p><p>5. No role playing during the prep process</p><p>Your prep is not you talking and your candidate listening. The prep is you role playing, listening to your candidate’s answers and offering suggestions.</p><p>6. Asking close-ended or multiple choice questions</p><p>If you ask questions that are multiple choice, you may be putting parameters up that don’t really exist. Your candidate’s answer could be, “all of the above” or “none or the above.” When you ask close-ended questions, you are limiting the information you will obtain.</p><p>7. Assuming what they have done is what they want to do</p><p>When you utilize percentages you must first have an accurate understanding of your candidate’s current job. You then ask what percentage of time they want to do specific tasks in their next job. Often they are making a change because they want to do either more or less of a specific task. Never assume that a person wants their new job to mirror their current job.</p><p>If you implement these solutions you will improve your matching skills.</p><p>Barbara J.

       "  'content': '<p>Background checks are now a standard part of the recruitment process. Different types of checks like criminal, educational and employment background checks are routinely carried out. However, not many recruiters check the social media backgrounds of job applicants. This is a potentially costly mistake – given the centrality that social media plays in most people’s lives.</p><p>In today’s world, the majority of people use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. for both personal and professional purposes. As such, these platforms can provide invaluable insight about a person’s character. Therefore, conducting social media background checks can provide useful info which can help a recruiter to make better hiring decisions.</p><p>Social media is an invaluable source of information for one simple reason: people tend to let their guard down on social media. They are more forthright than they usually are in their applications or during interviews. As such, social media posts can provide a more accurate picture of who a person really is. There are a number of reasons why social media background checks are invaluable. Here are some of the most important.</p><p>First of all, social media background checks can flag off behaviors which are unacceptable to an organization. For instance, there are people who openly brag about taking illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines. Some even post pictures of themselves in an intoxicated stupor. If an organization has a no-drug use policy, then social media can be a great way for identifying drug users.</p><p>Secondly, media checks can help to flag off behaviors which can damage an organization’s reputation. For instance, individuals who openly express racist opinions are a potential public relations disaster waiting to happen. Similarly, people who express sexist and religiously intolerant views or use derogatory language can damage an organization’s reputation. This is especially true if the individuals will occupy positions in which they are a visible representation of the organization.</p><p>A case in point is the fracas that was caused by the proposed appointment of Ran Baratz as the new media chief for Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Baratz’s proposed appointment caused a stir especially in the US, because of his vitriolic Facebook posts. He had previously called President Obama “anti-Semitic” and described US Secretary of State John Kerry as having the “mental ability of a 12-year-old.”</p><p>A simple social media background check would have avoided such a situation. It would have flagged off Baratz’s offensive posts, and caused Netanyahu to perhaps reconsider hiring him as media chief. That is exactly what a social media check can do to any organization. It can enable recruiters to identify social media behaviors which can be potentially damaging to an organization’s reputation.</p><p>Finally, social media background checks can be helpful for identifying unprofessional behavior. There are certain behaviors which are unacceptable in professional circles. For instance, there are people who post critical comments about their bosses or colleagues on social media. Such behavior causes resentment and destroys teamwork within an organization. As such, most organizations would reconsider hiring such people.</p><p>The bottom line is that social media background checks can enable recruiters to get a holistic picture of a candidate. This is especially true if it complements other types of background checks like criminal, educational and employment checks. Therefore, in order to get a complete picture of a job applicant, organizations need to include social media as a key component of the background checks strategy.</p><p>by Brett McIntyre</p><p>Link to article:\\xa0http://www.thestaffingstream.com/2016/01/06/why-a-social-media-background-check-is-invaluable-in-the-recruitment-process/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheStaffingStream+%28The+Staffing+Stream%29\\xa0</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>Real success is exhausting, because nothing good comes easy. Or to quote the late Dr. Scott Peck, “love is work, non-love is laziness, and anti-love is evil.”</p><p>Evil exists, but it is very rare. Most people are just lazy. Financially lazy, emotionally lazy, intellectually lazy, philosophically lazy — even work lazy. Most people, just don’t want to do the work that sustainable success requires.</p><p>Personally, 2015 was an exhausting year for me. My most exhausting yet, actually. And I really have no problem with this. Like I said, nothing good comes easy.</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell’s book “The Outliers” note than it takes 10,000 hours to become a master, or a best-in-class leader at whatever your chosen profession or passion might be. This boils down to about 20 hours a week, or a very real part time job.</p><p>And to be clear, this means 20 hours a week, on top of normal full-time job commitment. Whatever you want to achieve will take commitment, it will take hours, and it will be at times, exhausting.</p><p>If you want to be successful, or if you are presently experiencing what I would call ‘real success,’ then you can expect moments and stretches of exhaustion. But this is not to be confused with being ‘tired,’ because when you are tired, you actually don’t like what you are doing.</p><p>When you do what you are passionate about, you don’t get tired. You get worn out. You may be exhausted. But you actually love what you do, which is why you keep doing it — maybe to a point of ‘exhaustion.\\'</p><p>Life really is a math equation, on many levels. If you want true success, you are simply going to have to put in some serious hours. Success in anything.</p><p>If you want success in professional sports, you will have to put in serious hours of practice and preparation, not just actual play.</p><p>If you want to be a top attorney, you will have to do much more than finish law school. You will have to put in serious hours, to sit at the knee of noted legal experts, to study case law, to understand history and context, and remain connecting to all that is going on today. And of course, to run a successful practice too.</p><p>If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, you will have to invest serious hours, and to understand my entrepreneurship creed. “An entrepreneur works 18 hours a day, just to keep from getting a real job.”</p><p>But this is not just limited to the professions.</p><p>If you want to be a great parent, because maybe your mother or father wasn’t to you growing up — then you will have to put in serious hours at home, with them. There is no way around it.</p><p>When I see a successful leader who also happens to also be married, and I note that he or she enjoys a healthy relationship with their children, or just healthy children, I always try to commend the partner in that marriage as a similarly successful \\'Domestic Engineer.’</p><p>Running that household, and raising those children, and filling that home with love, took everything that the wife (in this particular, more traditional example) had, just like professional success required of the other here.</p><p>In 2015, I had to battle a \\'library of professional headwinds\\' that required almost everything I had.</p><p>Transformation of an organization from an old business model, into a new one.</p><p>Getting rid of what my friends at Gallup would call ‘highly disengaged’ workers.</p><p>Or workers who show up actively rooting for your failure. You are literally paying these people to undermine your vision; for yourself and your organization. They simply have to go. You will find a few of them even in the best of organizations.</p><p>Bringing in new talent and leadership, and doing it without sending some sort of a message to your current team that they ~ their jobs, their positions ~ are somehow also now ‘at risk.\\'</p><p>Bringing stakeholders along -- board members, partners, vendors, supporters, constituents, clients and customers along with you throughout all of this change.</p><p>Hitting my numbers and solving very hairy problems, in the midst of all of these other challenges and changes.</p><p>Taking in order for more than 280 new Operation HOPE locations dedicated to Project 5117, led by HOPE Inside and HOPE Business In A Box Academies.</p><p>I also had to find more than 3M in new cash revenue early in 2015 — literally out of no where. And I had to do this, while also keeping all of my other commitments.</p><p>Managing a local, mostly annoying challenge of being actively undermined by a former staffer. It did not work, and it did not last for long, but in the moment it was time consuming. And time is what I actually value most.</p><p>“If you ask me if I wanted more time, or more money, I would ask for more time. If I had more time, I could then make more money.\"</p><p>When you are top business leader, a government leader, a cutting edge innovation leader, or a market leader, or a sector leader, community leader, religious leader, moral leader or an industry leader, or any other kind of best-in-class leader ~ know and understand that it will take almost everything that you have to continue to win. To achieve sustainable success.</p><p>And so you ask, was it all worth it? Absolutely.</p><p>2015 was my most exhausting year yet, but it was also my most fulfilling.</p><p>We got the most done, expanded the mission in ways not seen in the previous 23 plus years, and transformed the baseline of the organization — from the inside out. All of this, while keeping the financials strong, and the organization firmly rooted in \\'good governance.\\'</p><p>We were able to inspire the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to rename a 100+ year old building, previously known as the U.S. Treasury Annex Building, to the Freedman’s Bank Building, in honor of President Lincoln’s mandate to create a bank after the civil war to ‘teach freed slaves about money.’ We see our HOPE Inside network as a natural extension of the Freedman’s Bank mission and mandate, and we opened more than three dozen HOPE Inside locations across the country in 2015.</p><p>And finally, we set up the environment for the hosting of our biggest and best HOPE Global Forum Annual Meeting for Operation HOPE (the organization I founded nearly 25 years ago after the Rodney King Riots in South Central Los Angeles, in 1992), scheduled for this coming week, January 13-15, 2016, here in Atlanta.</p><p>So, was it worth it? No doubt. Did it take everything I had, a little more that my family and team had — absolutely yes. But this, is what success looks like.</p><p>Love is work. Loss creates leaders, and rainbows only follow storms. You cannot have a rainbow, without a storm first.</p><p>I am a better person, and I believe a stronger and more clear headed leader after the hard work of 2015. I would not change a thing. My word for 2016 is to Execute. What\\'s yours?</p><p>Commit to your dreams, and don’t complain when occasionally those dreams make you want to scream. Nothing good, comes easy.</p><p>I like what Dr. Dorothy I. Height had to say about me. “I like you John, because you are a dreamer, with a shovel in your hands.\"</p><p>Let us now be dreamers, with shovels in our hands.</p><p>Let’s go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By John Hope Bryant</p><p>Article source:\\xa0https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-confused-real-success-exhausting-john-hope-bryant</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>Recruiter’s block: Noun, phrase. The condition of being unable to think of how to recruit people or how to proceed with recruiting.</p><p>No matter how long you’ve been in the space, you may have already hit the dreaded recruiting wall. A waning talent funnel. Snubbed emails. Dead open and response rates. Getting lost in the shuffle of competing companies is a common hiring nightmare.</p><p>Then comes flattery – express appeal, leverage, then negotiate. Try these three moves to stand out from the long list of contenders.<br />Ask about something they worked on. <br />This isn’t the run-of-the-mill recruiter template that, at the least, name-drops a press piece, blog post, or project. Take the M.O. of starting a conversation with someone you’re a fan of, over email. Use your subject line to specifically compliment what they’re associated with, like, a company achievement or something they’ve created. In the message, offer your response on the topic and ask a question.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><p>Subject line: Fantastic post about clever ways to recruit talent!</p><p>Hey Kathleen,</p><p>I just read your post with new ideas on attracting and engaging candidates. (Link) Interesting take! Our team’s always talked about doing candidate surveys, and I think this post was just the kicker for us to finally get started.</p><p>Question: What are your thoughts on texting candidates? I’m all for it, but the rest of my team thinks it’s an aggressive approach. What say you?</p><p>Hope your day is going well so far. Looking forward to hearing from you. Cheers!</p><p>Seeking insights from a candidate lets them know you value their opinion, and they’ll offer their two cents in return – the icebreaker to (tastefully) turning on recruit mode.</p><p>Requesting to use their work.<br />Similar to the previous point, asking for permission to use something a candidate’s created is another way to let them know you’re paying attention to their repertoire. Stumble upon an idea you admire and want to share, and use that as fuel to open up your conversation.</p><p>Survey candidates. <br />Here’s how to learn more about the people you’re recruiting, and to warm up to you recruiting them. You’ve probably been told to start being data-driven and if you don’t know where to start, try ramping up by studying the people you’re trying to hire.</p><p>One approach that recently caught my attention was a company reaching out to candidates over a 15 minute phone call for feedback on what they love most about their job. The trade-off was a $50 gift card for their time. Done tactfully, to start, you’ll attract people willing to wax lyrical about their role. “Talk to someone about themselves, and they’ll listen for hours.”</p><p>Fuel questions to get them to open up about what makes them excited about their role or the space they work in. Here are some questions to start: What got you interested in the space you’re in now? What do you love most about your work? What are some aspects that make up a good, strong company culture? What are some benefits and perks a company could offer that would make them stand out from others?</p><p>You’ll get a better understanding of the candidate market and how to make your opportunities stand out from the shuffle other companies vying for the same people. Even if you meet someone unhappy with their job but who can articulate what they are looking for, you’d land a prime chance to transition into talking about what your company can offer.</p><p>In one word, this post is about personalization. Like meeting someone for the first time, getting a candidate to warm up to you requires a gradual, calculated approach, and some research.

       "  'content': \"<p>“All our life is a mass of habits,” wrote philosopher William James. Habits, both good and bad, play a powerful role in our lives. Consider your habits at the office? Coffee, Facebook, check email, read the news, grab a snack. Which actively contribute to your success or inhibit it? Now, wipe the slate clean, because we’ve got five daily habits to drive your productivity and keep you recruiting like a rockstar.</p><p>Make a to-do list every day<br />What are you doing today? Do you know? Think about what reqs need to be written or approved. Do you need to finalize an offer or lock in a phone screen? Making a list of all the things you need to do, both big and small, allows you to map out your entire day and strategically hold yourself accountable. The present wealth of productivity apps make tracking stuff easier than ever.</p><p>Our favorites? We love Asana at Entelo because it’s useful for monitor and organizing projects and tasks between teams. But there’s also Todoist, Evernote, or even Remember The Milk. Once you’ve got a list, sync up with your team to see what can be delegated or shared. Also, periodically check in with hiring managers to help move candidates along in the hiring process. If you know what needs to be done, the odds of accomplishing those tasks will skyrocket. And that’s the first step towards killer results.</p><p>Check the pipes<br />Your pipeline is your lifeline, so make sure it’s operating at peak capacity and efficiency. How? Check on it daily to figure out what aspects are underperforming. Knowing the ins and outs of your pipeline is fundamental to all recruiting results and can drive actionable improvements. Lagging on referrals? Then send out a company-wide email with available positions and reiterate the referral bonus. Better yet, consider setting aside time to meet with employees to browse through their networks to find out who’d be qualified candidates.</p><p>Always ask yourself: What’s working? What’s not working? How can we improve? A strong pipeline keeps everything else running smoothly by making your hiring process quicker, more exact, and minimizes the disruption from unexpected vacancies to your company’s bottom line.</p><p>Prioritize relentlessly<br />Once your to-do list is written, prioritize tasks in descending order of the most pressing and time sensitive. Know your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), both those set for you and those you set for yourself. One great way to keep yourself focused: the 1-3-5 rule. This framework divides your daily to-dos into one important task, three medium tasks, and five small tasks. Align your to-do list with the 1-3-5 rule based on your KPIs and budget your time and efforts appropriately. If you always get your most important task done each day, accomplish most of the medium tasks and some of the small tasks, you’ll be in great shape. And if you haven’t figured out KPIs yet, here is a good place to start.</p><p>Geek out with metrics<br />Data is cool. You know what’s even cooler? Metrics. Metrics like total candidate pipeline, response rates for each sourcing channel and time to hire allow you to identify, isolate and fix problems, inefficiencies, and roadblocks. ATSs like Greenhouse and Lever now make it fairly straightforward to track candidates and outcomes, so there’s really no excuse.</p><p>The difference between a good recruiter and a great recruiter is that great recruiters are always working to get better; constant data-driven iteration is a foolproof way to improve your game. Always check to see what channels and actions give you the best ROI and which are lagging. Identifying what works best and what needs improvement will help you hone in on efficiencies and inefficiencies, making you a smarter, more effective recruiter.</p><p>Always be syncing<br />Never underestimate the value of teamwork in recruiting. Whether it’s your colleagues, managers, subordinates, or peers at another company altogether, sharing intel, asking questions and working together to tackle complex problems is the quickest way out of dead-ends. It also builds the kind of team-first ethic that is crucial in recruiting, especially since personal referrals are still the best way to find talented hires. It’s tempting for hunter-type recruiters to attack things solo, but the most successful companies and best departments are created by constant teamwork. Set up various daily and weekly touch points for your team, to make sure everyone is on the same page with hiring strategies, responsibilities, and priorities.</p><p>One tactic we’ve implemented at Entelo is setting aside 10 minutes for a quick post-interview candidate debrief. Did they meet expectations? Were they only qualified on paper or did they completely bomb the interview? Learning how to continually align recruiter-hiring manager expectations for candidates helps teams be more efficient selecting candidates and only moving forward with the best ones.</p><p>Daily habits are a powerful way to achieve amazing results and keep yourself goal-oriented. The key is to eliminate bad habits and create good ones. Let us know in the comments what your unique recruiting habits are.</p><p>Keep recruiting like an all-star – we rallied Kenny Mendes, of Box's founding recruiting team, to show you how.</p><p>January 28, 2016 at 12:16 PM William Clarke</p>\",\n",

       "  'content': \"<p>Pitch emails are your first touch point with candidates and ideally they begin a long, fruitful conversation that’s mutually productive.</p><p>The stronger the pitch, the more responses you will get, and the bigger your pipeline will grow. As we’ve said before, your pipeline is your lifeline. Here’s a guide on what not to say and do in your candidate emails so that you can recruit like a pro, and hire like a boss.</p><p>Let’s start with a few things candidates will see first.<br />Unclear Subject Line<br />Short, punchy, and straightforward are rules to live by here. NO ALL CAPS, ever. In general, you’re aiming for a subject line that is specific, brief, conversational and doesn’t feel too serious. You want to engage them without being pushy, vague or obnoxious.</p><p>Here are three styles I like:</p><p>Personalized and warm: Jack, loved your medium post on Series B rounds<br />Open-ended: Quick question when you have a moment<br />Direct, no-nonsense: Sales Opportunity with Fast Growing SaaS Startup<br />Thought-provoking question: Patrick, What’s Next?<br />If you’re doing research into your candidates, you should be able to get an idea of what they’re like. Pick a direction you think fits their personality and background. Some may go for the direct, straightforward message that gives them an overview before they have even clicked the message. Others may respond to a softer touch that begins as a conversation about something else before transitioning to their job prospects.</p><p>Bad Timing<br />In hiring, timing is everything. What do we mean? Well, most candidates switch jobs around their first, second or third work anniversaries, which makes two to four months before that anniversary the best time for you to message them.</p><p>Now let’s move on to your email message.<br />Make Demands <br />Remember, someone you’re sending a cold email to owes you absolutely nothing. While you may want to offer them a job eventually, your goal right now is to begin a conversation. You are already occupying their time, so always use a light touch. Make sure to convey that you respect their time and have zero expectations. That way you are deferring to them and their availability.</p><p>Being generic<br />It doesn’t take a genius to figure out when you have just received a mass email, so don’t be that recruiter. Instead, personalize every message. Call out something cool they worked on or led, like a GitHub fork, a blog post, a Tweetstorm, or a particular marketing campaign.</p><p>See a someone you know connected to them on their professional profile? Use the opportunity to namedrop your mutual connection.</p><p>Typos or bad grammar<br />The mistake of death. Misspelling a job candidate's name makes you look careless. Using poor grammar makes you look careless. A 2015 Hubspot study reported bad grammar as people’s number one pet peeve. If you’re not a stellar writer, Grammarly is a great way to double check your writing and even learn rules.</p><p>Burying the Lede<br />Don’t write a novel. Get to the point, explain why you are reaching out, why you’re touching base with them specifically, and propose any next steps. Two or three brief paragraphs at most should do it. If your message can’t be read in less than a minute, it’s too long.</p><p>Sounding like a Robot<br />You don’t want your email to sound like Siri wrote it. Use real human language and put some personality into it (but not too much). “Hey Bob, Hope you’re well. I don’t know whether or not you’re looking to change companies, but if so, I think you would be a great fit for an Enterprise Sales role here at Entelo.”</p><p>Before sending your message, read it out loud. If you wouldn’t say it verbally, don’t write it.</p><p>Misrepresent Yourself, Your Company or the Position <br />Don’t fudge details on salary, job title, or expectations. If you wind up losing a candidate because what you told them something that was not true, you’ve burned a bridge, made your company (and yourself) look untrustworthy, and wasted the time of anyone else who participated in phone screens or interviews.</p><p>Honesty is the best policy. Always. If your company can’t match their salary expectations or the candidate doesn’t want to make a lateral move, so be it. Your employer brand is sacrosanct.</p><p>BCC Multiple Candidates <br />Emailing multiple people at once puts you in the fast track to get embarrassed. We’ve heard multiple stories about people who received a pitch at the same exact time as a co-worker. Neither of those people are going to respond to you, so just don’t do it.</p><p>Leaving out an action item<br />Make sure they know what you’re looking for. Say, “I would love to hear your thoughts on the declining tech valuations and how you think that might impact hiring,” or “Do you think you’d be interested in hearing more about our company?” or “Let me know if you have any interest in hearing about new opportunities.”</p><p>Even better, send them a link to your careers page or a company culture video to revisit if they want a primer before responding to your email.</p><p>Not thanking them<br />People are busy and they receive a lot of emails. If they bothered to read your entire message, be sure to end on a positive note. Thanking them shows them you appreciate their time and ends on a note that could just be enough to get them to respond.</p><p>If you follow all of these tips, you’ll be in good shape. Think we missed something?

High school and college students log on remotely from their dorms, apartments, or computer labs to IBM System z mainframes, and are awarded prizes ranging from t-shirts for successfully completing Part One, to a laptop computer and a trip to IBM’s New York headquarters for winning Part Three.</p><ul><li>Part One introduces students to the mainframe and gets them comfortable with remote secure access to an IBM mainframe, while performing simple tasks. Typically this portion of the challenge takes an hour or two to complete.</li><li>Part Two introduces contestants to advanced commands and system setup techniques; students usually spend approximately 30 to 40 hours on this portion of the match. Those who complete Parts One and Two receive hands-on experience in four operating systems (IBM’s mainframe z/OS; Linux on System z; z/Transactional Processing Facility, and z/Virtualization Machine).</li><li>Part Three is the most technically daunting coding challenge. Competitors utilize IBM’s Rational Developer for System zEnterprise coding tool to create complex, high-end CICS, IMS, DB2, and Batch applications to solve real-world business problems devised by IBM engineers.\\xa0 The engineers typically take up to three months to review completed submissions; 2013’s top three finishers will be notified in March.</li></ul>',\n",

Attended Butler University in Indianapolis with a Biology and Chemistry Degree. Can speak French, and am probably in the top ten in the state of Indiana for karaoke. I worked as a Molecular Biologist doing cancer research at Duke and UNC. Became a Recruiter at ClinForce, then moved into Sales in late 2008/early 2009. I’ve been in sales ever since.</p><p><strong>Donna Nguyen - Researcher, NYC\\xa0</strong></p><p>I recently graduated from Montclair State University in May where I began working at the Public Relations agency I interned at during my last semester. I love crafting (I make amazing coasters and photo albums) and attempting to cook new recipes found on Google. I am very excited to join the Green Key team and getting started in the fast paced world of recruiting. I look forward to meeting everybody soon!\\xa0</p>',\n",

Congrats all (both are pictured above).</p><p>In other fun GKR news, Sean Wiener (AF NYC, pictured above with his fiancé) and Rosa Goldstein (AF Temp NYC) have also recently accepted proposals to their significant others. This has all been going on while Meredith Brod (HC Temp NYC) was planning her wedding to Jake and Mike Meluzio (Accounting) was marrying his wife. Congrats to you all!</p><p>We’ve welcomed a new GKR baby, Jodi Perlmutter’s (Pharma NYC) adorable Lucas was born 1 month ago, his little picture is featured here as well.
